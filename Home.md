Nothing in it ye, will need more fleshed out vault to see how I want to use this.

I do want it to be the landing page of the vault and the jumping off point for daily use.

Ideas of things this could hold:

A list of Maps of content
using dataview a block showing the 5 latest edited notes
a lil intro block
a randomiser?

For now I am of the mind that all notes should link to the home note
