As I go along with my reading I might find ideas for later permanent notes, so as to not forget the impulse this file is a collection of lists where each section is a potential permanent note topic and the list contains the literature notes related to the topic. This can be a good starting point what to work on.

Once the permanent has actually begun I remove it from this page.
