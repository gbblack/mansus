# Transitioning from the Attention Era to the Automation Era

> [!abstract] Summary
> An article presenting the idea that with the rise of AI the economy of attention will have to shift to one of automation.
## Highlights
---
==**transitioning== from** earning and packaging ==**attention== to** selling summarization and ==**automation.**==

moving from _time-spent_ to _time-saved_.

the Attention Era – was marked by the creation of giant piles of content and connections ... **==spend== more ==time== with them.**

the Automation Era – is marked by platforms managing the content and connections for you, so you can ==**spend== your ==attention== elsewhere.**

OpenAI’s ChatGPT will read web pages for you. Apple’s Apple Intelligence will read your notifications. And Google’s Gmail will summarize long threads and emails.

One question raised is **==what will be automated and what will deserve attention?==**

Sadly, it’s not hard to imagine the market continuing to bifurcate along economic lines: **those with money will be able to ==pay for automation== while those without will have to ==sell their attention.==**
