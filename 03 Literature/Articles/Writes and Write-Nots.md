# Writes and Write-Nots

> [!abstract] Summary
> The author predicts that the rise of AI will reduce writing, and therefore thinking, from an essential learned skill to an optional one.
## Highlights
---
> in a **couple decades there ==won't be many people who can write.**==

> One of the strangest things you learn if you're a writer is how **many ==people== have ==trouble writing.==**

> The reason so many **people have trouble ==writing== is that it's ==fundamentally difficult.== To write well you ==have to think clearly==, and ==thinking clearly is hard.==**

> the **pervasive expectation of ==writing== and the ==irreducible difficulty of doing it==**, create enormous pressure.

> Till recently there was no convenient escape valve for the pressure created by these opposing forces.

> if you couldn't buy or steal words, you had to write them yourself. And as a result nearly ==**everyone== who was expected to write ==had to learn how.==**

> **Not anymore.** AI has blown this world open. **Almost ==all pressure to write has dissipated.**== You can have AI do it for you, both in school and at work.

> The result will be **a ==world divided== into ==writes and write-nots.==**

> there will just be ==**good writers== and ==people who can't write.==**

> Yes, it's bad. The reason is something I mentioned earlier: ==**writing is thinking.**==

> You can't make this point better than Leslie Lamport did:
> **If you're ==thinking without writing==, you ==only think you're thinking.==**

> It will be **a world of ==thinks and think-nots.==**

> This situation is not unprecedented. In preindustrial times most people's jobs made them strong. **Now if you want to be strong, you work out. So t==here are still strong people, but only those who choose to be.**==

> ==**There will still be smart people, but only those who choose to be.**==
