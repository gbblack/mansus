# You are NOT Dumb, You Just Lack the Prerequisites

> [!abstract] Summary
> The limiting factor in learning isn't intelligence, it is the knowledge base you have. If a topic is too difficult, start at the beginning and work your way forward. 
### Highlights
---
> It’s like walking into a movie halfway through—**you can’t understand the plot because you ==missed the beginning==.**

> The gap in comprehension wasn’t due to a lack of ability but rather ==**a gap== in prerequisite knowledge**.

> Each ==**foundational concept== I mastered ==laid the groundwork== for more complex theories** and problems.
