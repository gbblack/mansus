# The Day You Became A Better Writer

> [!abstract] Summary
> Dilbert comics piece of advice. To improve writing keep things small. Ideas and sentences.
## Highlights
---
> Business writing is about clarity and persuasion. The main technique is keeping things simple. **==Simple writing is persuasive.== A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences.** Don’t fight it.

> Simple means getting rid of extra words. **Don’t write, “He was very happy” when you can write “He was happy.” ...  . ==Prune your sentences.**==

> Your **==first sentence== needs to ==grab the reader.==**

> **Write short sentences. ==Avoid putting multiple thoughts in one sentence.==** Readers aren’t as smart as you’d think.  

> **==Learn how brains organize ideas.== Readers comprehend “the boy hit the ball” quicker than “the ball was hit by the boy.”** ... . All brains work that way. (Notice I didn’t say, “That is the way all brains work”?)
