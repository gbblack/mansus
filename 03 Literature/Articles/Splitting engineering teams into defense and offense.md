# Splitting engineering teams into defense and offense

> [!abstract] Summary
> An article describing an engineering team structure split into two groups: defensive for work that maintains the product, and offensive for work that adds to it.
## Highlights
---
the reason we get anything done at all in these circumstances has to do with a specific way in which we **==structure== our engineering team.**

the idea that makers, such as **software developers, were different from managers in that they ==need long, uninterrupted hours to build great things**==

**Without dedicated technical support teams** and usually with immature products, **==engineers take on a lot of support work==**

**The engineering ==work that comes from customers==,** whether it is general support, bug fixes, or small modifications **can be considered ==“event-driven”== engineering.**

**The engineering work that includes longer-term (more than a week), ==ambitious projects==**, can be considered ==**“long-running”== engineering.**

We instruct half the team (2 engineers) at a given point to work on long-running tasks in 2-4 week blocks.

During this time, **they ==don’t== have to ==deal with any support tickets== or bugs.**

The other half of engineers must simply protect the first two from any support work, bugs, etc.

At the end of the cycle, we swap.

it’s far **more useful to ==isolate interruptions== to a few people** rather than disperse them to “keep everyone productive”.

A mental model that I have found useful is to **view ==event-driven engineering as “defensive”== and ==long-running processes as “offensive”.==**

==**Defensive== engineering exists to ==maintain your product==**, whereas ==**offensive== engineering exists to ==expand it.==**
