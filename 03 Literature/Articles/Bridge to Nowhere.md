# Bridge to Nowhere

> [!abstract] Summary
> Reflections on modern medical care when concerning terminal diagnoses. The procedures doctors follow are focused around pushing for surgery and clinical trials rather than relating the true reality of the situation to the patient. This reduces patient agency at a time when they are most vulnerable, and misrepresents the cost of care.

> ==**I don't remember being asked== if I wanted one. Rather, ==I was _told_== that I would have one** and that it would happen soon.

> What bothered me was the glaring ==**absence== of Option (3), which was to do ==nothing==.**

> Not being presented with it left me feeling **==railroaded**==.

>  I'd assumed that surgery would allow me to return to the life I'd known before entering the Emergency Room. **I ==wrongly viewed my choice== as: refuse surgery and die in three months or have surgery and get on with the life I knew**

> The kind of tumor I was suspected of having **was going to kill me with or without surgery. Surgery might buy a year and change if I were lucky**. But that's only if I underwent post-surgery treatment.

> My medical report does state that **a conversation like the one I would have wanted did take place — but ==right before my surgery. I don't remember having that conversation== at all**, nor did my family, who was with me in the hospital, witness it.

> And if the doctor were being completely candid, they would have told me that the recommended option, **surgery to remove the tumor ("resection"), was a ==bridge to nowhere.**==

> A bridge to nowhere is a bridge where one or **both ends are ==broken, incomplete, or unconnected**== to any roads.

> If the mess at the far end of the resection bridge were plainly laid out for patients thinking of hopping onto the onramp anyway, that would be one thing. **The ==decision== could then be made with a ==clear understanding ==of the cost and benefits**.

>  Then they'll be told there's something in their brain that must be surgically removed immediately. **But they won't be told exactly what that surgery can buy. And they most definitely ==won't be told the probable cost==.** In case it's not clear, I'm not even talking about money, but rather suffering and anguish.

> **They ==deserve the truth== — all of it. They deserve to be ==treated as capable adults==.** They don't need to be coddled as if the unvarnished truth will destroy their will to live. They don't deserve baseless praise for next-generation sequencing or the vaporware of personalized medicine.

> The current ==**dismal== state-of-the-art ==care==** means that for the vast majority of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma, surgery is a bridge to nowhere.
