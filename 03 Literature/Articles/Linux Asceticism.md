# Linux Asceticism

> [!abstract] Summary
> The author reflects on minimal Linux distros being a way to practice asceticism and how that can lead to self improvement.
## Highlights
---
Most well-known living philosophies -such as Cynicism, Epicureanism, Stoicism, Buddhism, and Sufism- **advocate some form of ==Asceticism.**==

**Strengthening your ==body and mind== to make yourself ==indifferent to and indifferent from==** the things that are outside your control.

When people **argue for ==using Linux**==, they **often focus on either political or practical** reasons.

However, there’s another often-overlooked aspect that can make using a minimal Linux distribution worthwhile: **using ==a minimal Linux distro== on your personal computer i==s a form of Askesis==-disciplined practices done for ==self-improvement==.**

It will ==**force you to learn== more and more and you’ll also begin to ==appreciate the underlying elements==** that are often hidden away by the layers we rely on. **This effect will be amplified especially if you like to tinker and try to ==make things happen as you want them to be.**==

In the end, **you’ll ==gain a deeper understanding== of what happens under the hood.** Your comfort zone will broaden as **you develop the ==mindset of solving problems.**==
