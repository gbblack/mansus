# Poisoning the day

> [!abstract] Summary
> Productivity advice focused on getting as much done in the day as early as possible before outside events have the chance to derail it, and when they do just roll with it and reschedule.
## Highlights

> “Every day is a new beginning. You wake up and at some point in the day, someone shoots up a school, or something’s going on with your family, or you wake up and eat the wrong thing. And then you’re done. Emotionally cooked. Literally and emotionally poisoned."

>   This, to me, is what 90% of productivity advice on the internet is really about: **how to ==get through as much of your day as possible before something takes you out.**==

> This is what I particularly love about Antonoff’s idea: its fatalistic acceptance that ==**focus can’t be sustained indefinitely.== At some point, you’re done.** The magic is gone. You’re not getting it back.

> Best option. ==**Get as much done as early as possible.== Limit your exposure to outside stimuli.** And run the gauntlet until the poison strikes.

> And **when it does, ==don’t fight it. Reschedule== anything demanding to the next day.** Shift to easier tasks or simply call it and start on dinner.

> **Not an early riser? No problem, just flip it.** Avoid the day. And when it’s done, that’s when your focussed work starts.

> **Every day when you wake up, there’s a clock ticking. You have no idea when it will run out.**
> The only question is: how much can you do before it does?
