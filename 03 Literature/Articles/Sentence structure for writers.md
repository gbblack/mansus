# Sentence structure for writers: understanding weight and clarity

> [!abstract] Summary
> A short exploration of weight in sentence structures and how sentences with an early verb and heavier end-weight are easier for the audience to understand.
## Highlights
---
Some sentences just sound awkward. **In order ==to ensure clarity==, writers need to consider more than just grammar: ==_weight_ is equally important.==**

Here’s another example. Which of these two sentences sounds more natural?
`The trouble began suddenly on the thirty-first of October 1998.`
`The trouble began on the thirty-first of October 1998 suddenly.`

The first pair illustrates how **English speakers like to place the ==‘heavier’ part of a sentence towards the end==** rather than at the beginning. … Both **illustrate the principle of ==_end-weight==_.**

she would say such things as _see red car_ long before she said things like _red car gone_. In grammatical terms: **she expanded her ==object before== she expanded her ==subject.==**

Taking in such a sentence, we feel the ==**extra demand being made on our memory.== We have to keep those eleven words in mind before we learn what the speaker or writer is going to do to them**.

The **==sooner they get to the verb==, the sooner they will get a ==sense of what the sentence is about.==**
