# I've had a change of heart regarding employee metrics

> [!abstract] Summary
> An article on employee metrics and the authors new ethos that the entire field should be interacted with as little as possible. The measurement of performance is to be used against you always.
## Highlights
---
It's the **==job of a manager to know what their reports are up to==, and whether they're doing a good job of it**, and are generally effective. If they can't do that, then they themselves are ineffective, and *that* is the sort of thing that is the responsibility of THEIR manager, and so on up the line.

So, my new position on that sort of thing is: fuck them. **==Don't help them.==** Don't write tools like that, don't run tests to see if your teammates will take care of basic "service hygiene" issues, and definitely don't say anything substantive in a performance review. None of it will "move the needle" in the way you think it will, and it will only make life worse for you overall. **"Peer reviews actually improve things" is about the biggest crock of shit that people in tech still believe in.**

**==Make them do their own damn jobs.==** You have enough stuff to do as it is.

Those tools I wrote 20 years ago didn't really indicate who was slacking at working tickets or whatever. **What they *actually indicated* was that the ==management== at Rackspace, by and large, ==had no clue what was going on== right under their noses.**

So, why expose yourself? Suppress the urge to point out who's slacking. It will only come back on you.
