# Flesh and Blood

> [!abstract] Summary
> A comparison on Roman and later European violence occurring within the home/society vs. the Native American understanding of violence belonging only to those outside the community. The difference in defining freedom in relation to one's absolute power over another rather than the assimilation of the other into oneself.
## Highlights
---
> British anthropologist named A. M. Hocart proposed that **monarchs and ==institutions of government were originally derived from rituals== designed to channel powers of life from the cosmos into human society.** He suggested that “the first kings must have been dead kings,” and that individuals so honored only really became sacred rulers at their funerals.

> When Europeans first encountered **North American societies, the only kings that existed were ritualistic play kings. If they overstepped the line, their ==subjects were always free to ignore them or move someplace else.**== The same went for any other system of authority. A police force that operated for only three months of the year and whose membership rotated annually was, in a certain sense, a play police force—which makes it slightly less bizarre that their members were sometimes recruited from the ranks of ritual clowns.

> Existing debates almost invariably begin with terms derived from Roman law, which conceive of ==**freedom as based on the power of the individual== (by implication, a male head of household) to dispose of his property as he sees fit**. It is a blunt reality that someone in possession of a thing can do anything he wants with it, except that which is limited “by force or law.” Jurists have struggled with this formulation ever since, as it **implies that ==freedom== is essentially a state of primordial ==exception to the legal order.**== It also implies that property **is not a set of understandings between people about who gets to possess things, but rather ==a relation between a person and an object of absolute power.**== 

> An answer is suggested by the sociologist Orlando Patterson, who points out that conceptions of property (and hence of freedom) in Roman law can be traced back to slave law. It is possible to imagine **property as a ==relationship of domination== between a ==person and thing**== because, in Roman law, the power of the master rendered the slave a thing, not a person with rights or legal obligations. (...) The very word “family” shares a root with the Latin _famulus,_ meaning “house slave,” via _familia,_ which referred to everyone under the domestic authority of a male head of household.

> What seems to have really shocked them, however, was not the whipping, boiling, branding, or cutting up of the enemy, but the fact that almost ==**everyone== in a Wendat village took part, even women and children.** The violence seems all the more extraordinary once we recall how these **same societies refused to spank children, punish thieves and murderers, or take any measure that smacked of arbitrary authority. In virtually all other areas of social life they were renowned for solving problems through calm and reasoned debate.**

> what struck them as most remarkable was that “**the French whipped, hanged, and put to death ==men from among themselves” rather than external enemies**==

> While **Native American rituals showed the desire to ==seize the strength and courage of an outsider== so as to combat him better, the European ritual revealed the existence of a ==dissymmetry==, an irrevocable imbalance of power within society itself.** As a Wendat traveler observed of the French system, anyone—guilty or innocent—might end up being made a public example.

> Children were to submit to their parents, wives to husbands, and subjects to rulers, whose authority came from God. In each case the superior party was expected to inflict stern chastisement when he considered it appropriate: that is, to exercise violence with impunity.

> Wendat torture, in the same period, created searing, unforgettable spectacles of pain and suffering to make clear that no form of physical chastisement should ever be countenanced inside a community or household. ==**Violence and care==, in the Wendat case, were to be entirely separated.**
