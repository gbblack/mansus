# You Must Read At Least One Book To Ride

> [!abstract] Summary
> Essay espousing the idea that reading at least one good book on topics you wish to learn is all you need to jump ahead of the curve both professionally and personally. The trick is in finding the *good* books.
## Highlights

Eventually I decided that I "wasn't artsy" and didn't draw anything other than doodled cubes for about ten years.

This led me to Betty Edward's Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain, ... The book came with glowing recommendations, but it also came with before and after pictures that I assumed were too good to be true. The _after_ picture felt so unattainable that saying you could get to that level felt like a weight loss scam.

I was prepared to go _my entire life_ missing out on the joys of art until I picked up the right book. **I am ==still typically the worst artist when I enter a room full of artists,== but ==people _outside those rooms==_ (who didn't read one book) occasionally ==think I'm pretty okay==**, which is something I never expected to experience.

**There are the ==engineers who have read 1+ books== on a given topic, and sometimes on _several_ topics, and they all ==come off as extremely competent.==**

**Then ==there are engineers== (and people in every profession) ==who _never try for the entirety of their careers_==**, and this is the majority of every profession. ... the average professional as sleepwalking through their working lives, and this rung true. Of course, they are not _literally_ asleep so something else is going wrong, but the description still seemed apt. There is movement - enough movement to fall down a flight of stairs - but none of the awareness needed to avoid such an outcome.

**Then there are ==people like myself, where I have read _exactly_ one good book== on most ==topics relevant to my profession,== but have never gone particularly deep.** I have a firm grasp of the Git data model through Pro Git, for example, but know nothing about the algorithms underlying it - which is still enough to dominate a truly randomly selected engineer. ... **I have spoken to high-performers in all sorts if fields at this point, and _every single one_ ==has said that their profession is plagued by people that are essentially not even trying.**==

This led to the topic of how deep specializations can go, and just how goddamn good people can get. I know very little about basketball, but Seth linked me to this video where one of the worst players in the NBA, ten years post-retirement and out-of-shape, assassinates both amateur and professional athletes from lesser tiers. And he's _one of the worst players_, or so I've been told by people that actually know basketball.

I can't help but feel that something has gone dreadfully wrong in society in that we've decided to start incentivizing people with no talent or interest to participate in the technology space. Many of them are extremely wide awake in other areas, be it sports, art, mathematics, whatever. Unfortunately for complex reasons ... we're willing to pay people to be extremely bad programmers and extremely bad leaders.

But since they're producing nothing _anyway_, or are a net negative to society accounting for opportunity cost, I can't help but feel that they'd somehow be so much more fulfilled if they got the sack somehow and we provided them all that money to just like, take care of their children and stop fucking around with databases they keep damaging.

> My worst job was my first job. It was very important to me, ... And it was everything I wanted and it made me miserable. Finally, I was so bad at it that it could no longer be concealed from the editor. I got the sack, ... I was very depressed, I thought "how will I ever recover", "I'll never get another job", "maybe I can't even keep my union card". **But I still sometimes think about it, and think =="If I had been any good at that job, I might still be doing it."**==

Something about having your skin in the game is that your relationship with sleepwalkers changes. **That is, instead of resenting them, you're _glad that they're so bad_ because they give you people to beat without having to dedicate your entire life to perfect performance.**

==**Reading one book _typically_ gets you to the point== where you can do things like "add new functionality to this React app without incurring technical debt".** This is good enough to make an ethical living, so long as you intelligently chose to do a thing that society pays for.

But because Deloitte and the average developer don't read _any_ books, they're just easy pickings. When you're trading off all your skin-in-the-game and working a permanent job, your interactions with these people leave you feeling helpless. You have to work with whoever the boss tells you too, and if they suck then you just have to deal with that.

**Heck, you could probably eliminate almost all dud candidates during technical interviews by asking what their favourite tech book is**, then only talking to candidates where you know enough to check if they've read that book. **You'd have a false negative on anyone that read a great book you didn't know about, but I'm guessing almost no false positives.**

But now we get to a complicated case - what about the people that try very hard but nonetheless get no results? **I know several people that ==run teams incompetently but are _genuinely trying_. However, no amount of training seems to get them there.**== They harass engineers, they panic, they don't know how to hire, they usually overestimate their own skill, but they're _trying_. They just _keep_ trying to get Scrum right.

There are all sorts of things that cause this outcome, but I wanted to highlight a meta-skill that many of us have but can't quite articulate, and I suspect it's what they're missing. **That is, ==how do you know what books to read?==**

I don't think I can explain _exactly_ how I do it, or if there's a precise algorithm. **It certainly seems like you need a little ==bit of bullshit detection**==, so in the tech space I'll typically only read something from a person who has built something impressive themselves. Big points for maintaining something open source or otherwise having **some ==indicator of knowledge== that is ==impossible to fake.==**

**Even ==_within_ a book==, you have to be able to ==discard large segments that don't have merit.==**

**==Not having whatever that ability== is seems to ==cripple== many people's ==ability to learn== and better themselves.** This is why it's so concerning when you hear some executives disclose their reading material - it is typically _immediately obvious_ that there is almost no way they are actually good at their job.
