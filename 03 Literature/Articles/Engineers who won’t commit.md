# Engineers who won’t commit

> [!abstract] Summary
> When you are the most senior (or knowledgeable) person in the room when a decision is being made you *must* stand up and make one. Not doing so is a moral failing as it pushes this responsibility on those who are less equipped to deal with it. 

---
> Some engineers think it’s a virtue to remain non-committal in technical discussions.

> This strategy is fine when you’re a junior engineer, but at some point you’ll be **the person in the room with the most context (or technical skill, or institutional power). At that point, ==you need to take a position==**, whether you feel particularly confident or not.

> If you don’t, you’re ==**forcing people== with less technical context than you ==to figure it out==** themselves.

> If you’re **a strong engineer, it’s your ==responsibility to take a position**== in order to prevent that from happening, even if you’re only 55% or 60% confident.

> Like most forms of cowardice, **==remaining non-committal feels like sensible caution== from the inside. After all, technical problems are complicated.** There are always reasons to express uncertainty or to add caveats to a statement.

> I think what’s often motivating this attitude is that many engineers (me included) really, really, pathologically hate being wrong.

> But I also see it for what it is: cowardice. **When ==people are relying on you== to make a call, you ought to ==step up and make it==.**

> In my experience, managers are very forgiving when you make a technical call and it ends up being incorrect. That’s because their job involves making a lot of educated guesses as well, so they’ve internalized that some guesses don’t pan out.

> If you’re the ==**only one== stepping forward to answer, that can ==still be valuable even if you’re wrong.==** Going in the wrong direction will at least often give you information, or provide a base to iterate on.

> However, sometimes avoid estimates isn’t a matter of cowardice. In some companies, engineers avoid firm estimates because they’ll face real, unfair consequences when those estimates aren’t met.

> I’m saying **you should ==force yourself to make commitments== _when you’re the person in the room ==best positioned to know the answer_==.**

> **If you ==don’t take a position==, you’re tacitly ==endorsing the decision== that eventually gets ==made==**

> The harder the decision, **the more ==uncertainty== you should be ==willing to accept==**

> It can be **==genuinely scary== to make a claim that you’re not sure about.** But you should still do it
