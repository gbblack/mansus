# Ask for no, don’t ask for yes

> [!abstract] Summary
> When trying to take action in the workforce it is difficult to create momentum if we wait for permission. Instead inform your boss that action will be taken and they can weight in later. This shift allows for change that would otherwise have been delayed.

> **==Moving forward allows you to make progress.==**

> One habit I like is to ask for no, not yes.

> When you have something you want to do and that you feel is in scope for your position, but you want a bit of reassurance or to let the boss know what you are up to, **it’s common to reach out and ask them for permission. Don’t. ==Don’t ask for a yes==. Instead, ==offer a chance to say no,== but with a deadline.**

> I could say “hey, boss, can we install action X? It’ll help with the XYZ problems we’ve been having.”
> If you have a busy boss (and most people do), this is going to require a bit of work on their part to say “yes”.

> Now, let’s take the alternative approach.”Hey, boss, I am going to install action X, which should solve the XYZ problems we’ve been having. Will take care of this on Monday unless I hear differently from you.”

> **==You are saying== (without being explicit) that ==you “got it”==** and are going to handle this issue.
