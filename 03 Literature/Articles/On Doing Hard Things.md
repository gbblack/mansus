# On Doing Hard Things

> [!abstract] Summary
> Reflection on learning to kayak and doing "hard things".
## Highlights
---
==**Progress== in kayaking ==doesn’t feel like progress.==** You just fall in slightly less. Your stroke gets marginally quieter. The boat wobbles less when you breathe. Eventually, you start noticing things like water texture, wind direction, and the turtles on the banks. I**t’s less a sport than a slow, ==immersive calibration of self to environment.==**

**My team captain ==encouraged me== in the way good leaders do: ==not by pretending I was better than I was==, but by ==acting like improvement was inevitable if I kept showing up.==** That assumption helped.

Less than a year in, I was told I’d made varsity. A few months after that, **I competed in my first inter-tertiary race. ==I did not win. I did not flip.**== Both outcomes were equally surprising.

**Kayaking taught me to ==be okay== with repeatedly looking ==dumb in public.==**

==**It’s easy to over-index on success stories.**==  But I think there’s a quiet dignity in the almost-stories too.
