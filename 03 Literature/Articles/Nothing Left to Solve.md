# **Nothing Left to Solve**

> [!abstract] Summary
> A post on the idea that some software problems can be considered solved, and that doing more work on these problems worsen them rather than improve them.
### **Highlights**
---
> if they want to **develop something that appeals to everyone**, there must be a ==**genuine problem to address.**==

> **==questioning== whether there is indeed ==a problem**== to solve at the moment.

> At some point, we ==**solidified the layout== of a calculator.** If we change it too much, **we ==diminish== value ==rather than add== to it.**

> we have ==**solved some software problems**==

> Some things **may ==not require redesigning==. We might have simply figured them out.**
