# Free Software Needs Free Tools

> [!abstract] Summary
> Developers committed to open source/free software ideals and principles must also extend them to the tools they use to build their free software. By conceding freedom in tools to create free software you jeopardise that software freedom by its reliance on nonfree closed source tooling. 
## Highlights
---
> Over the last decade, free software developers have been repeatedly tempted by development tools that offer the ability to build free software more efficiently or powerfully.
> **The only cost, we are told, is that ==the tools themselves are nonfree== or run as network services with code we cannot see, copy, or run ourselves.** In their decisions to use these tools and services—services such as BitKeeper, SourceForge, Google Code and GitHub—**free software ==developers have made “ends-justify-the-means” decisions that trade away the freedom of both their developer communities and their users.**== These decisions to embrace nonfree and private development tools ==**undermine our credibility in advocating for software freedom and compromise our freedom==, and that of our users, ==in ways that we should reject.==**

> Similar projects like CollabNet's Tigris.org, Google Code's “Open Source Project Hosting” services, and GitHub, each served similar purposes and have kept their code similarly out of reach. **Their services are often provided without charge and promoted for free software development, but this commitment does not extend to their own software that runs the development platforms.**

> For a series of reasons though ==**these companies choose to support software freedom through means that are less in line with free software ethics than the ones they seek to create.** ==The result is developers who are disempowered. ==**The software freedom of the code these hackers produce is contingent on unacceptable exclusivity.**==

> First, the use of nonfree tools sends an unacceptable message to users of the free software produced. **“Software freedom is important for you as users,” developers seem to say, “but not for us.” ==Such behavior undermines the basic effectiveness of the strong ethical commitment at the heart of the free software movement.**== As those that are already committed to free software, we should demonstrate that we can succeed—and thrive—using free software. We should support free alternatives to proprietary systems such as Savane which can replace SourceForge or Google Code and runs GNU Savannah, or Gitorious which can replace GitHub—by using them and by improving them in the areas where they fall short.

> Secondly, we should realize that, going forward, ==**the software we produce is only as free as the software it depends on for its continued use, distribution, and evolution**==

> **Those ==choosing to use nonfree tools put everyone at the whim of the groups and individuals who produce the tools== they depend on.**

> In the controversial area of private software and network services, **free software ==developers should err on the side of “too much” freedom. To compromise our principles in attempts to achieve more freedom is self-defeating, unstable, and ultimately unfair,==** to our users and to the larger free software development community.

> Just as the early GNU maintainers first focused on creating free tools for creating free software, we should ensure that we can produce software freely and using unambiguously free tools. ==**Our failure to do so will result in software that is, indirectly, less free.== We should resist using tools that do not allow us the freedoms we are trying to provide our users in the development of _their_ software and we should apply pressure on the producers of our development tools.** Free software has not achieved success by compromising our principles. ==**We will not be well served, technically, pragmatically, or ethically, by compromising on freedom of the tools we use to build a free world.**==
