# Always Go To The Funeral

> [!abstract] Summary
> A philosophy of doing the right thing always, especially when it is a small inconvenient thing, like going to the funeral.
## Highlights

I believe in always going to the funeral. My father taught me that.

I did not want to go. My father was unequivocal. "Dee," he said, "you're going. Always go to the funeral. Do it for the family."

It was worse than I thought it would be: I was the only kid there. When the condolence line deposited me in front of Miss Emerson's shell-shocked parents, I stammered out, "Sorry about all this," and stalked away. â€¦ Miss Emerson's mother still remembers my name and always says hello with tearing eyes.

I remember two things from the funeral circuit: bottomless dishes of free mints and my father saying on the ride home, **=="You can't come in without going out, kids.== Always go to the funeral."**

But I think a personal philosophy of going to funerals means more than that.

"Always go to the funeral" means that **I have to ==do the right thing== when I really, really ==don't feel like it==.**

**I'm talking about those things ==that represent only inconvenience to me, but the world to the other guy.==** You know, the painfully under-attended birthday party. The hospital visit during happy hour.

In my humdrum life, **the daily battle hasn't been good versus evil.** It's hardly so epic. Most days, my **real battle is ==doing good versus doing nothing.**==

In going to funerals, I've come to believe that while I wait to make a grand heroic gesture, **I should just ==stick to the small inconveniences== that let me ==share in life's inevitable==, occasional ==calamity.==**

The memory of it still takes my breath away. The most human, powerful and humbling thing I've ever seen was a church at 3:00 on a Wednesday **==full of inconvenienced people who believe in going to the funeral.==**
