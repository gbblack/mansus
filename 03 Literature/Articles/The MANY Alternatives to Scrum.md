# The MANY Alternatives to Scrum

> [!abstract] Summary
> A list of non-Scrum project management strategies, with the underlying message that the best one is the one that works for your team and your priorities.
## Highlights
---
1. **==Kanban==** is different from Scrum—there are **==no sprints==** (rejoice!). **When you ==finish a task==, you ==simply pull the next one from the top of the backlog,== which should always be ==in priority order.==** … _there is no need for estimates_. ==**If an emergency arises==,** everyone pauses their work … . **A new emergency ticket is created, and the ==whole team focuses on pushing it across the board== as quickly as possible.** Once it's resolved, the paused tasks can be resumed. Kanban also enforces **Work in Progress ==(WIP) limits for each column== on the board. In other words, there’s a ==maximum number of items that can be in progress== at any given time in any column.** The team can set and adjust these WIP limits as needed, and they’re usually written at the top of the board above each column. This helps focus attention on bottlenecks where work may be piling up. Before pulling new tasks, you’re encouraged to first look to clear out columns that are at capacity.

2. At **==Valve==**, … There are **no closed doors either—==anyone can join any project that interests them.==** Because employees choose which projects to work on, ==**projects== thrive or fade away ==based on their ability to attract talent.==** There’s **==no central authority== deciding the company's next move. … ==Temporary, cross-functional work groups, known as _cabals_,== form spontaneously around important work.** Project teams create temporary internal structures to meet immediate needs. The closest thing to a team lead is the person who, by keeping track of the project in their head, naturally becomes a hub of information.

3. Don’t forget, the **==Agile Manifesto== and the ==Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto== are excellent foundations** for building your process.

4. At Basecamp, ==**feature work runs in six-week sprints==, followed by a ==two-week break where developers have unscheduled time.== They can use this time for anything they want—bug fixes, research, training, etc.** This is a huge improvement over the constant strain of back-to-back sprints … . **==Each project cycle is time-boxed.== If work ==isn’t finished== after six weeks, it’s not automatically renewed but ==must instead go through further planning to determine if more work _should_ be done.**== During the six-week cycle, ==**teams have full autonomy== to adjust their project scope to fit within the time frame.** They also **handle their ==own task planning and release strategy,== aiming to deliver the _best version_ of the project that can be completed in six weeks.** This approach avoids the painful and wasteful sizing rituals common in Scrum and gives developers more time and energy for implementation. Basecamp's **process, known as ==Shape Up==**, is well-documented online, with a wealth of information available.

5. While each **==Open Source==** project is unique, they traditionally follow a model where an ==**individual with full authority**== (often called the "benevolent dictator") **==leads the project.==** **This person owns every aspect—coding standards, design, release cadence, quality level, CI strategy. … ==Other programmers either run their own projects or volunteer their efforts to existing ones.**== **Project owners attract contributors by showing promise through working code.** They release frequently, even if the code is buggy or incomplete—**==it just needs to demonstrate potential.==** Owners serve as gatekeepers, rigorously reviewing contributor code to ensure it aligns with the project’s vision before integration. However, owners have write permissions and can push their own changes whenever they want.

6. Today, **==Spotify==** is made up of **==small, cross-functional _squads_ — self-organizing teams responsible for their own missions.==** They are ==**free to choose their own methodologies== and even ==release software independently.**== Rather than having standard practices mandated by leadership, **squads ==naturally converge on certain practices== that become de facto standards.** Squads and individuals are further organized into broader groupings. **==Tribes are collections of squads.== ==Guilds== are groups of individuals who share ==common interests**== (e.g. Leadership, Continuous Integration, AI). **==Chapters== bring together ==individuals in the same discipline**== (e.g. QA, Agile Coaching, Web Development).

7. In **==XP==**, developers collaborate closely to manage shared code ownership. Most notably, **==all work is done in pairs.==** Pair programming ensures that **no one gets stuck for long and that knowledge is shared continuously.** This is essential for maintaining momentum and handling the complexity of a collectively owned codebase. … XP encourages several other practices to get faster, better feedback. For example:
   - ==**Shorter iterations**==: … .
   - ==**Test-Driven Development== (TDD)**: … .
   - **==Continuous Integration== (CI)**: … .
   **XP emphasizes ==direct collaboration.==** This **approach ==shortens feedback loops==, helps the team better ==understand the problem domain==, and enables them to ==focus on delivering the right solution.**==

8. No matter how well you know Scrum —whether you’re a programmer or a certified Scrum Master, **==let the team run the show.==** Don’t cling so tightly to “your way” that the team can’t change it. Let them change whatever they think will make them more effective. Let them do irregular sprints that don’t run back-to-back; let them add items to the backlog without the PO’s permission; let them do stand-ups once a week; let them ban estimates.
