# Leaving and Waving

> [!abstract] Summary
> A photo-essay on family and saying goodbye to them. It is a collection of photographic goodbyes from one set of parents to their daughter.
## Highlights
---
> For 27 years, I took photographs as I waved good-bye and drove away from visiting my parents at their home in Sioux City, Iowa.

> When I discovered the series of accumulated “leaving and waving” photographs, I found a story about family, aging, and the sorrow of saying good-bye.

> When I left after her funeral, I took one more photograph, of the empty driveway. For the first time in my life, no one was waving back at me.
