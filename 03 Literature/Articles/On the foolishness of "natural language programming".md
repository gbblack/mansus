# On the foolishness of "natural language programming"

> [!abstract] Summary
> An essay by Dijkstra remarking on the false assumption that natural language programming would outperform traditional programming. He points out that formal symbolism is what makes all this possible, not an obstacle to be overcome.
## Highlights

Since the early days of automatic computing we have had **==people that have felt== it as a ==shortcoming that programming required== the ==care and accuracy== that is characteristic for the use of any formal symbolism.** They blamed the mechanical slave for its strict obedience with which it carried out its given instructions, **==even if== a moment's ==thought== would have ==revealed== that those ==instructions contained an obvious mistake==." But a moment is a long time, and thought is a painful process." (A.E.Houseman).**

Machine code, with its absence of almost any form of redundancy, was soon identified as a needlessly risky interface between man and machine. Partly in response to this recognition so-called "high-level programming languages" were developed, and, as time went by, we learned to a certain extent how to enhance the protection against silly mistakes. It was a significant improvement that now many a silly mistake did result in an error message instead of in an erroneous answer. ... **The (abstract) machine corresponding to a programming language remained, however, a faithful slave, ... Programming remained the use of a formal symbolism and, as such, continued to require the care and accuracy required before.**

**In order to ==make machines significantly easier to use,== it has been proposed (to try) to design machines that we could ==instruct in our native tongues.**== this would, admittedly, make the machines much more complicated, but, it was argued, by letting the machine carry a larger share of the burden, life would become easier for us. **It ==sounds sensible provided you blame== the obligation to use a ==formal symbolism as the source of your difficulties.** ==But is the argument valid? I doubt.

We know in the meantime that the choice of an interface is not just a division of (a fixed amount of) labour, because the work involved in co-operating and communicating across the interface has to be added. We know in the meantime —from sobering experience, I may add— that a change of interface can easily increase at both sides of the fence the amount of work to be done (even drastically so). Hence the increased preference for what are now called "narrow interfaces". Therefore, **although ==changing to communication between machine and man== conducted in the latter's native tongue ==would greatly increase the machine's burden==, we have to ==challenge the assumption that this would simplify man's life.**==

**The ==virtue of formal texts== is that their manipulations, ==in order to be legitimate==, need to ==satisfy only a few simple rules==; they are, when you come to think of it, an amazingly ==effective tool for ruling out== all sorts of ==nonsense== that, when we use ==our native tongues==, are almost ==impossible to avoid.==**

When all is said and told, the "naturalness" with which we use our native tongues boils down to the ease with which we can use them for making statements the nonsense of which is not obvious.

Remark. As a result of the educational trend away from intellectual discipline, the last decades have shown in the Western world a sharp decline of people's mastery of their own language: many people that by the standards of a previous generation should know better, are no longer able to use their native tongue effectively, even for purposes for which it is pretty adequate.

From one gut feeling I derive much consolation: ==**I suspect that machines to be programmed in our native tongues== —be it Dutch, English, American, French, German, or Swahili— ==are as damned difficult to make as they would be to use.**==
