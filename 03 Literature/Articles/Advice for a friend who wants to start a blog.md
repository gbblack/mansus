> [!abstract] Summary

## Highlights

**==It is what is odd about you that is interesting==**. ... Just try to amuse yourself.

**Your contradictions are an asset.** You’re a lover of classical English architecture _and_ you’re also a dirty little punk—expressing both at the same time is more interesting than sharing _just_ cute pictures of English gardens or _just_ wild trashy stuff.

People tend to sound more like themselves in chat messages than in blog posts. So perhaps write in the chat, rapidly, to a friend.

Not that many people will care about what you write, at least for the first few years, s**o ==make the writing useful to you.==Write in a way that lets you refine your thoughts about the things that matter.** Write to experience what you care about in higher resolution—write to enhance your feeling of aliveness.

**You have to put your ==thoughts in order.== But the time to do this is _before_ you write for publication.** Think: musicians practicing hard so they can be in the moment when they improvise. Read, take notes, study, question yourself. But then, when writing a post, let that go, and rely on the brain power you have accumulated.

Don’t aim too high when you write your first posts. Maybe just do 500-word pieces, and do them with a simple format.

**==To grow skilled==, you need to ==push yourself outside your comfort zone== and put your goals a little beyond what you can pull off.** But also? You need to finish and publish stuff because there are certain things you can only learn by finishing.

He didn’t rewrite the sentences, moving commas and phrases around—he flipped a page and wrote a new draft from scratch. This is a way to learn from your attempts without sacrificing the life that comes from writing fast.

But a blog is a tiny internet house where you decide the norms. And since there are already countless places where you can't be yourself, there is no need to build another one of those. The law of the land is that everything you think is funny is funny. Those who find the texture of your mind boring or offensive can close the tab—no need to worry about them. **==It is good for the soul to have a place where being just the way you are is normal.==**
