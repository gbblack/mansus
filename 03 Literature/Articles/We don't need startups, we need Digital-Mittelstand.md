# We don't need startups, we need Digital-Mittelstand

> [!abstract] Summary
> An article proposing a focus on Mittelsand type companies in the tech industry of Germany. Arguing that the German culture and Silicon Valley are fundamentally at odds. Highlights the stable, focused and long lived opportunities available to be made by bringing Mittelsand into the digital world.
## Highlights
---
> no country has succeeded in creating its own Silicon Valley. Why? Either these leaders fail to grasp the nuances of what made Silicon Valley what it is, or they lack a deep understanding of their own nation’s cultural fabric.

> The reason is simple: **==Silicon Valley== isn’t merely a hub of companies, tax breaks, and venture capital—it’s a unique ==ecosystem driven by culture.**== It’s a magnet for individuals from diverse backgrounds united by one shared ambition: make a dent in the universe.

> In Germany, the cultural landscape is strikingly different. Few people are driven by the ambition to “change the world”—perhaps because they feel they’ve already contributed their share as a nation.

> However, if you’ve ever used a product marked “Made in Germany,” you’ll understand what **==German culture== truly values: ==mastery of a craft== and uncompromising ==quality.==**

> They’re ==**not the kind to release half-baked products== and patch issues later, nor are they likely to push for higher prices just to fatten shareholders’ returns.** The average German ... isn’t particularly moved by shareholder value, especially when the Basic Law of Germany begins with “Human dignity shall be inviolable.” **The ==entire culture fundamentally opposes== many hallmarks of the t==ypical startup ethos.==**

> If you’re unfamiliar with ==**Mittelstand==, it refers to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany.** While there’s no formal definition, these **companies typically have ==fewer than 500 employees and annual revenues under 50 million Euro.==**

> What sets Mittelstand apart from SMEs in other countries, however, **is their ==laser-sharp focus on a single niche==, in which they excel.** A significant portion of their income comes from exporting high-quality goods.

> By catering to **==super-specific markets== with== few competitors== worldwide, ==demand== for their products ==remains steady==, no matter the economic climate.**

> If you’ve ever worked with Mittelstand companies, you’ll know that many have a long queue of customers waiting for their products. ... Yet **==customers are willing to wait== because they know these ==businesses either produce the best quality or are the only ones making== the product at all.**

> The challenge, however, is that Mittelstand companies primarily focus on physical goods. Unlike major tech giants, they can’t enjoy the massive profit margins of producing digital products with zero marginal costs.

> **While ==startups often begin with a focus on creating a minimum viable product== (MVP), they ==tend to evolve into growth-hungry==, investment-driven ==machines.**== ... This expansive growth strategy stands in stark contrast to Mittelstand’s ethos, which centers on focus, mastery, and sustainability. **==Mittelstand companies prioritize doing one thing exceptionally well==, guided by a core ==ideology of longevity and conservative, long-term financial planning.==**

> Most startups are built with the goal of either being acquired by a tech giant or going public. **Mittelstand, however, ==aims to create lasting value for customers and employees==—not shareholders.** Startups also demand extreme dedication, often expecting employees to work 60–80 hours a week with little regard for work-life balance. In Mittelstand, ==**employee well-being is a priority==, encouraging a healthier balance between work and personal life.** Even in today’s highly competitive AI industry, the startup world thrives on cutthroat competition. Mittelstand, by contrast, operates in niche markets with limited competition due to their specialized products.

> Given these cultural and structural differences, I believe the traditional startup model won’t work in Germany. Instead of chasing a Silicon Valley model that no other country has successfully replicated, Germany should focus on developing the Digital-Mittelstand.

> Creating a digital product doesn’t require massive capital investment—a small team of a designer and a developer can be enough to launch something meaningful. **With fewer employees, ==companies can prioritize long-term goals, refine their product iteratively, and maintain lean operational costs.== Once the product gains traction, the zero-marginal-cost nature of digital products allows them to scale without incurring significant additional expenses.**

> These are just a few examples, and **many can be classified under Software as a Service (SaaS).** While these products don’t require massive capital investments, they do rely heavily on expertise. ==**By focusing on niche markets and high-quality offerings, Digital-Mittelstand companies can carve out profitable, sustainable businesses.**== With minimal competition and zero-marginal-cost scalability, **this model offers a long-term, ==balanced approach to growth and innovation.**==
