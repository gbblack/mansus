# **Stop Using Fandom**

> [!abstract] Summary
> A call to action to move wikis away from the hosting site Fandom, as it exploits its user generated content for ad revenue.
### **Highlights**
---
> you will experience what i like to call **=="attention assault"==**

>  a multi-thousand-dollar furniture purchase to go with my video game bug lore. **i have been using fandom for 1 second and i already ==want to leave==.**

> the video shrinks into the bottom-right corner of my screen and **==stalks me== around the website, ==begging for attention==.**

> fandom was about **==profit==**

> what, dear readers, do venture capitalists want when they **invest $40M into something?==returns. at all costs.==**

> **mcdonald's ==paid fandom== an unknown amount of ==money== to temporarily ==replace the mcdonald's wiki main page== + grimace article** with advertisements promoting the grimace shake.

> fandom set the precedent that **==companies could pay== them and make ==user content go *poof*==**

> one predictable **outcome. ==mass exodus.==**

> ==**over 300== wikis have ==migrated away== from fandom**, and i can only hope that this trajectory accelerates.
