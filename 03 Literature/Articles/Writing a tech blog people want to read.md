# Writing a tech blog people want to read

> [!abstract] Summary
> A blog post on how the author writes his tech blog. Includes details on his writing process and some of the web tooling underneath it.
## Highlights
---
In general, I think the recipe for a popular post is **to have a ==clear opinion== about working in tech that many people disagree with**.

I get most of my ideas for blog posts by just ==**writing down== the things I’m ==already thinking about== as a part of regular work.** I don’t sit in an armchair and think “what does it mean to be a strong engineer”, I encounter strong engineers in my regular work and (naturally) think about what they’re doing differently.

I **touch on the ==same themes== fairly regularly** - the importance of being agentic and tactical, how companies value results, what makes engineers strong or weak

I try to **be as ==clear and casual== as possible.** This is largely influenced by grad school in analytic philosophy, which aims to be much more straightforward in tone than other liberal arts fields.

One thing I explicitly do differently from philosophical writing is I **try ==not== to include ==too many caveats.==**

Sensible readers will know that of course you’re speaking from your own experience, and other readers won’t pay attention to the caveats anyway.
