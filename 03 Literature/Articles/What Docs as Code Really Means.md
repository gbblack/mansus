# What Docs as Code Really Means

> [!abstract] Summary
> Documentation as code is more than an afterthought. It is infrastructure, same as software and requires architects and standards in the same way. Doing this creates more robust software that is better understood by all who engage with it.
## Highlights
---
Writing **good documentation is ==key infrastructure work**==. Remove documentation, or fail to provide it, and your products cease to exist

Docs are infrastructure because they allow people to ==**use== the product ==without being== the product.** In that, they share the same importance of servers, routers, and cloud service providers.

When we say docs-as-code, what we’re really saying is that **technical writers are performing ==critical work close to the code== and to the reality of its development.** Docs-as-code is not, in this sense, a symbolic gesture of writerly solidarity towards engineers: it’s becoming engineers to help products ship, succeed, and sustain themselves autonomously. And when we say docs, it’s not just manuals, but also embedded documentation, from UI texts to context help to error messages.

If docs are infrastructure, it naturally follows that docs must be published following the **same ==methodology== your organization applies to code** and key deliverables.

Having documentation in the definition of done is _not_ enough. **There have to be ==standards and rules== in place.** Or, if your organization doesn’t follow any formal procedure for developing and merging features, **docs can ==lead by example==.**

==**well tested== documentation can often compensate for hasty product development** much in the same way good infrastructure can cope with inefficient code, even if momentarily. Docs mitigate and alleviate.

**software engineering ==doesn’t stop at the drawing board== or the text editor.** It concerns itself with how the final product is assembled.

Both sides need each other: you can’t move the needle of great docs without the dedication of the entire engineering org, and **engineers struggle to create great docs without a docs architect.**

we’re ==**architects of understanding==, building bridges between complex systems** and the humans who use them.
