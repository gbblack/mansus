# Boring tech is mature, not old

> [!abstract] Summary
> An article elaborating on the author's feelings that a technology becomes boring not when it is old but when it is mature. With maturity defined by the completeness of the ecosystem surrounding it.
## Highlights
---
> **The ==opposite of being bored is to be surprised==, and that’s not something a sysadmin desires when building**, maintaining, scaling, troubleshooting, upgrading, or even replacing a complex system.

> **==Boring tech behaves in predictable ways.==** It’s a well trodden path others have evaluated, optimised, troubleshooted, and understood. Using tech that has been subjected to all those people **hours of use means you’re ==less likely== to run into edge cases, unexpected behaviour, or attributes and ==features that lack documentation==** or community knowledge.

> What it does teach is that it pays to make informed decisions, and that **often times t==he understood, reliable, boring tech will get you there== over something new,** shiny or propped up with marketing spin.

> I’d conclude by suggesting **boring tech isn’t old, but _mature_. ==Maturity not just in the software, but its documentation, community, and track record.**==
