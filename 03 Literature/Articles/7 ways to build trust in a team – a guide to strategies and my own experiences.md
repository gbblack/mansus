# 7 ways to build trust in a team – a guide to strategies and my own experiences

> [!abstract] Summary
## Highlights
---
> Over time, I have come to understand that **==trust== is the invisible ==glue that binds people together== and allows them to ==achieve goals beyond their individual capabilities.==**

> Every day we have the ==**opportunity to strengthen relationships== with our team ==through small gestures, honest conversations,== and ==overcoming challenges== together. If ==we neglect these activities, trust will begin to erode==,** and rebuilding it will be much more difficult than when we started.

> Relationships are based on noticing people and communicating openly and honestly, especially in difficult moments. **For these ==relationships to be authentic== and for participants to feel empowered, we need to ==build mutual trust with them.==**

> While the team had high credibility in terms of knowledge and competence, there was a lack of reliability and closeness in the relationship between the leader and the team. This led to low levels of commitment and mutual support. **==Credibility without reliability== and closeness is ==not enough to build trust in a team.**==

> Zak also points to **benefits such as ==lower stress levels, greater job satisfaction and stronger bonds== between employees. ==Trust also fosters greater innovation==, as employees are more willing to take risks and seek new solutions** in an atmosphere of support and acceptance.

> ==**Trust is important**== not only for good collaboration, but also for ==**employee engagement and loyalty.**==

> The study also found that **in teams where ==employees feel safe==, they are more ==likely to learn, ask for feedback, admit mistakes==, and seek help.** Edmondson also found that psychological safety has a positive impact on team effectiveness.

> According to the authors, the most important elements of a decision-making process that is considered fair are
> 1. ==**Involving employees in the decision-making process**== – People who have the ==**opportunity to voice their opinions== and participate in the process feel respected**, even if their ideas are not ultimately implemented. Such participation builds a sense of shared responsibility for the outcome of decisions.
> 2. ==**Transparency**== – Open communication about the criteria for making decisions and how they will be implemented **helps employees ==understand why a particular decision was made.== Transparency prevents speculation and the growth of mistrust within the team.**
> 3. ==**Explaining why**== – Leaders who take the time to explain why a decision was made and the basis for it **help ==reduce employee resistance.==** These explanations give the impression that the process was thorough and thoughtful.

> **Building ==trust must start at the top==, especially in hybrid and remote teams.**

> organizations face significant **challenges in developing leaders, including ==the problem of selecting the right people for leadership positions.**== … are increasing the need for specific leadership skills, such as emotional intelligence, social intelligence and empathy.

> While research does not show this directly, I can say from my own observations that **many ==companies promote leaders based on their performance== in previous roles ==rather than on their leadership skills.**== As a result, those promoted to leadership positions often do not have the right skills to lead a team.

> ==**Listening and responding with empathy.**==
> In my daily work, I strive to be an ==**active== and fully present ==listener==,** trying to understand the other person’s perspective. I always try to respond to the needs of team members. … I don’t pretend that everything is fine, but I tell them straight out that I missed something. … I also ==**regularly check in== with team members about their well-being, both professionally and personally.**
> Practical steps:
> - implement an open door policy,
> - during meetings, focus on the other person – don’t interrupt and try to understand their perspective,
> - treat disagreements as opportunities to learn and better understand each other,
> - when someone on the team is facing challenges, offer support – both professionally and, when appropriate, personally,
> - respect each other’s privacy boundaries and never disclose confidential information without permission.

> ==**Giving employees autonomy and opportunities for growth is an important part of building trust within a team.**==
> I do not like to tell team members how to do their jobs. I am also a **strong ==opponent of micromanagement.==** This approach can be uncomfortable for both the employee and the manager, and **in the long run it ==tends to build== relationships based on ==fear rather than mutual trust.==** It also limits self-development. … **With a ==distributed organizational structure==, ==decisions== can be made much ==faster and more efficiently== than ever before.**
> Practical steps:
> - **==delegate== tasks with ==full responsibility,**== and instead of controlling every step of the work, ==**delegate entire projects== or parts of them to team members,**
> - avoid micromanaging and **try ==not to interfere with work== methods** unless there is a compelling reason to do so,
> - **encourage decision-making,** speak up at the end, and offer support when needed,
> - in situations that require quick action, communicate the need for urgency while showing understanding of the team’s adjustment process.

> ==**Share thoughts and rationale for decisions**==
> I have always **tried to ==be transparent**== about the motivations behind the decisions we make. This **helps the team ==understand the context and the goals== we are pursuing.** … It’s worth ==**establishing a routine== of regular and open ==synchronization meetings== in the organization,** where teams can find out what’s really going on in the company.
> Practical steps:
> - **==communicate regularly==** and institute meetings where the entire company can share company news or progress on projects,
> - **==share both successes and failures,==** and talk openly about challenges.

> **==Encourage people to question the status quo and admit their own mistakes==**
> Throughout my career, I have tried to **==foster a culture== where ==anyone can challenge the status quo== and suggest new approaches.** … But when we question something and want to change it, **the truth is that we ==won’t always succeed.**== No one is infallible. That’s why when I complete tasks, I try to ==**learn from them in public== and be open about when something went wrong.** … In this way, we build mutual trust and solve problems faster.
> Practical steps:
> - **openly ==admit mistakes,**== and when you do something wrong, **inform the team and ==conduct an analysis== of what can be done better** in the future,
> - **encourage the ==sharing of lessons learned== to create a culture** where mistakes are viewed as a source of knowledge rather than shame,
> - **demonstrate by example that ==development is a process**== in which we all participate, regardless of our position.

> ==**Respect the time of others and be punctual**==
> One of the most important **elements of ==building your credibility,== which leads directly to trust, is ==respecting other people’s time.**== When a leader is regularly late, it sends a signal that he or she does not respect the time of others and is incapable of managing his or her own time.
> Practical steps:
> - plan your day carefully, taking into account the time it takes to move between meetings (and while you work) and potential delays,
> - avoid overloading yourself with meetings,
> - if you know you may be late, let people know in advance,
> - **show your team that ==punctuality is important**== to you to encourage others to adopt a similar attitude,
> - start and end meetings on time, stick to the agenda, and do not prolong discussions unnecessarily.

> ==**Share information from your personal life in a balanced way**==
> Another thing I strongly recommend when building trust is to share aspects of your personal life as appropriate. … **==When leaders are authentic== and open about their experiences, it ==allows team members to better understand them== and build deeper relationships.** … maintaining professionalism and respecting the boundaries of privacy.
> Practical steps:
> - **be ==open about your experiences,**== but maintain an appropriate level of professionalism,
> - avoid oversharing private details that may be uncomfortable for others or unrelated to work,
> - encourage team members to share their experiences, **creating an ==atmosphere of mutual support== and understanding,**
> - ensure that **everyone feels comfortable and ==is not pressured to share information** ==they do not want to share.

> ==**Recognize and appreciate the team’s achievements**==
> When employees feel that their work is noticed and appreciated, their commitment and sense of belonging to the organization increases. It’s all about sincere words of appreciation and thanks for contributions to team, departmental, or organization-wide goals.
> Practical steps:
> - **take the time to have ==one-on-one conversations**== that highlight a person’s strengths and recognize their contributions,
> - recognize team members publicly, such as during group meetings.

> He presented a model of the relationship between trust and effectiveness. Sinek points out that ==**organizations often promote== people ==based on their performance==, ==neglecting== the aspect of ==trust== that other ==team members have in them.**==

> In Sinek’s model, employees are evaluated on two axes:
> - efficiency – how well someone performs their tasks,
> - trust – how trustworthy a person is and whether others can rely on him or her.
> Sinek emphasizes that ==**ideal leaders== are those who are both ==highly effective and trustworthy.**== In practice, however, companies often tolerate individuals who are highly effective but untrustworthy, which can be detrimental to organizational culture.

> Confidence Equation developed by Charles Green:
> Trust = Credibility Reliability Proximity / Focus on self
> Where:
> - ==**credibility**== means whether I have the knowledge and competence to build trust,
> - ==**reliability**==, whether I consistently keep my promises and deadlines,
> - closeness, what kind of relationships I build with team members, whether I am available to them,
> - self-centeredness, meaning the more I focus on my own goals at the expense of the team, the lower the trust.
> Using this model can help you identify areas you need to work on.

> The concept of psychological safety, developed by Amy Edmondson, emphasizes the importance of creating an environment in which employees feel safe to speak up and make mistakes.
> In practice, this means:
> - encouraging open communication without fear of negative consequences,
> - treating mistakes as opportunities to learn rather than to punish,
> - showing empathy and understanding for different perspectives.
> If you don’t know where to start, you can try introducing rules to increase psychological safety, such as not judging team members during brainstorming sessions and valuing everyone’s contribution.
