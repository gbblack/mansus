# Coming home

> [!abstract] Summary
> An article explaining the author's ethos for hosting and making her independent blog and not engaging with her work (writing) primarily through social media. She believes that the very format of social media disrupts our ability to think and therefore write. As such the inverse is also true, in building her own site she is able to create a format designed to improve, uniquely, her own thinking and writing. The medium transforms the message and messenger.

I’ve written before about the ==**restlessness inherent to screens==, the inability to ever linger or pause or catch your breath. It’s a strangely disembodied experience**, a sense of ceaseless, rustling motion when nothing is moving at all

It’s curious, the way we refer to media that comes at us as a _stream_, whether of moving pictures or sentence fragments, as if it were the mere flow of cool, fresh water running smoothly and gently at our feet. But all it takes is one big storm, and your friendly little stream becomes a gushing torrent of mud and debris

**One ==meaning of the verb “distract” is to separate,== to draw apart.** To separate the body from the spirit. To draw apart, or perhaps to draw _out,_ ... ==**Another meaning is madness.**==

**To step into the ==stream of any social network**==, to become immersed in the news, reactions, rage and hopes, the marketing and psyops, the funny jokes and clever memes, the earnest requests for mutual aid, for sign ups, for jobs, the clap backs and the call outs, the warnings and invitations—**it can ==feel like a kind of madness**==. It’s unsettling, in the way that sediment is unsettled by water, lifted up and tossed around, scattered about.

**I’m less interested in ownership than I am ==in _context._**== Writing on my own site has very different affordances: **I’m ==not typing into a little box, but writing in a text file.== I’m not surrounded by other people’s thinking, but located within my own body of work.**

==**A website is==, among other things, ==a _container.==_ The shape of that container ==both constrains and makes possible== what goes within it.** This is, I think, one of the primary justifications for having your own website. Not just so you can own your stuff . ... But also so that you can _shape_ the work—so that you can give shape to it, and in that shaping make possible work that couldn’t arise elsewhere.

It’s allowed me to cultivate the soil to suit my purposes—rather than having to adapt my garden to the soil I was given.

This is, **objectively, a ==difficult way to publish.==** There’s a great deal of friction between an idea or phrase coming to mind and the words making it out into the world. ... but the actual mechanics of sharing that writing. I mean, I am the fool who opens their damn terminal every time they want to publish; in recent weeks, I have spent a not insignificant number of hours writing some absolutely criminal CSS. ... And more often than not, I find that **what ==I need is some friction==, some _labor_, the effort to work things out. ==Efficiency is an anti-goal==; it is at odds with the work, which requires resistance and tension in order to come into being.**

This is one of the many reasons why **I find the current conversation about ==so-called generative AI so immensely frustrating**==: there’s all this hype about **making everything easier and faster, about ==how we can eliminate all the work involved== in the making of words and images.** But no one arguing for this seems **to have asked ==what’s left when the work is gone.==** ... I fear that nothing changes, that nothing is changed in such a making, least of all ourselves. But then, what does it mean to be unchanged, ... But ==**in eliminating the effort==, in refusing the temporality of making, the outcome of an ==“AI”-driven creative process is a phantasm==,** an unsubstantiality, something that passes through the world without leaving any trace.

And yet: **as much as ==the Fediverse is different**== (the governing structures, the incentives, the moderation, the absence of ads and engagement tricks), **so ==much of it is also unsettlingly familiar==—the same small boxes, the same few buttons, the same mechanics** of following and being followed. The same babbling, tumbling, rushing stream of thoughts. I **can’t tell if we’re ==stuck with this design because it’s familiar, or if it’s familiar because we’re stuck.==**

And so I remain at an unresolvable juncture: the intersection of the very strong belief that we must experiment with new modes and systems of communication, and the certain knowledge that every time I so much as glance at anything shaped like a social feed, my brain smoothes out, the web of connections and ideas I’m weaving is washed away, and I tumble downstream

**But maybe we ==need more _weird_==**—not in the very recent sense of the word, but **in the sense of prophesy or potential, a spell or charm, the magic, the wild, ==the _wyrd_—that which is becoming,**== rather than that which has already passed us by.
