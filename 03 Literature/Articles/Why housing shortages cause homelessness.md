# Why housing shortages cause homelessness

> [!abstract] Summary
> Areas with the highest housing costs also have the highest rates of homelessness. This is because in high cost areas family and friends cannot afford the extra space (rooms) necessary to house loved ones who are at the edge of homelessness.

## Highlights

Her story echoes the widely repeated observation that ‘people don’t become homeless when they run out of money, **they ==become homeless when they run out of relationships’.**==

But imagine for a moment a much simpler story: _Diona stayed with her mother_. **That story is short and boring. It’s ==common and unappreciated==.** And if Diona’s family had happened to **live in a cheaper part of the country and rented a bigger house**, it might have been her story.

The American cities with the ==**highest housing prices== have the ==worst homelessness problems==.**

But, when you think about it a bit, it’s not clear exactly how high rent contributes to homelessness. It’s not like $800 per month apartments are any more affordable to most homeless people than $1,000 per month apartments.

people without money who **avoid becoming homeless do so mostly by ==staying with others, usually their own parents==.** This happens outside the formal housing market. But parents’ and others’ ability to offer space is limited by what they can afford in the market.

Although unemployment and **drug abuse are risk factors for ==individual homelessness==, they are ==negatively correlated== with the rates of homelessness across cities.** In fact, the cities with the highest rates of homelessness, such as San Francisco and New York, are those with the ==**highest wages==, least unemployment, ==lowest poverty== rates – and ==highest housing costs==.**

**Housing ==costs and individual risk== factors both matter** – and the puzzle piece that links them is **the ==role of family and friends==.**

When space is tight, **the people ==forced out== are those who are ==hardest to live with==.**

To think about the full spectrum of living situations, we need to move **beyond the ‘housed versus unhoused’ binary and think about ==personal factors==.**

It wasn’t a sudden shortage of cash that pushed her into temporary homelessness, it was the emotional cost of arguments with her boyfriend and mother. **These relational shelter transactions ==take place outside the formal market for housing==, with its leases, mortgages, and listings. Such transactions are ==undertaken in currencies like amiability, chores, affection, and forgiveness== – but they rely on upstream market transactions.** Sabine’s ability to offer her daughter a backstop depends on her own ability to afford an apartment with a little extra space.

Sabine’s spare bedroom is an example of what social scientists call **‘decommodified housing’. ==It is not available to the highest bidder … It’s for her loved ones==.**

**==everyone== has ‘some degree of ==shelter insecurity==’,** and everyone is working within their own financial, and psychological, budget.

We can imagine a ladder of possible sleeping situations for any given person – the best thing is at the top, the worst at the bottom.

Doing so reveals that the ==**vast majority== of very poor people ==avoid homelessness==. And they often do so by ==staying with friends and family==.**

about a ==**fifth== of the homeless had ==five-figure annual incomes==** while three quarters were enrolled in food assistance.

Those who match the **demographic profile of the homeless, but ==manage to stay housed==, tend to do so in ==low- or moderate-cost metros==**. And the single, housed poor who do live in expensive metros are less likely to have their own place and more likely to live in group quarters.

Cities that reduce homelessness will likely do so by **allowing people to keep themselves ==housed in imperfect situations==.**

==**Empty bedrooms== are more common in poorer, low-rent cities than richer, high-rent ones.** These data tell Sherman’s story at a macro scale: middle-aged people in suburban Ohio, for example, are more likely to have an extra bedroom they can offer to an adult child than are middle-aged people in suburban Los Angeles.

Most education researchers treat doubling up as a problem. **But it’s also a ==solution: these shared homes== blur the line between market and nonmarket sectors,** because they normally rest on a kinship or friendship basis, but with everyone expected to contribute.

**Regardless of income, having extra space gives ==both sides a chance to disengage without leaving the home==,** to set their own standards, and maintain some privacy.

**==time runs out== faster when the ==couch is in the living room==** rather than a spare bedroom.

people at risk of homelessness manage to remain housed by staying with others. The **higher rate of homelessness in high-cost areas is mostly explained by the ==inability== of the ==family and friends== of potentially homeless people ==to afford extra living space==.**

How much of the homelessness gap **between high- and low-cost areas does ==mismeasurement== account for? ==We don’t know==.**

But it also noted that the ==**vast majority== of homeless people are ==picked up by family members== in lower-wage (and thus lower-cost) places** when they get off the Greyhound bus.

This essay has been about **those who live close to the ==blurry boundary between being housed and unhoused==.** Such people are not the poorest, most desperate, or most in need of assistance.

Most homelessness discourse is about the chronic, hardcore homeless. But the truth is that people in Nolan’s situation are those whose problems will be most thoroughly solved by the types of reforms that he and I support. ==**Making housing more abundant and allowing cheaper options== will lower prices, expanding the ability of ==family and friends to provide homes==.**

no homeless service professional fools herself into believing that a house key will cure alcoholism or schizophrenia.

The framework put forward in this essay offers a way past this debate: in a moderate-cost city, ==**housing reaches those at the margins== of homelessness primarily ==through family members and friends==** willing to double up.

Dysfunction in the formal housing market is ==**squeezing out== those who would otherwise ==find housing in informal ways==.**

Trying to solve **homelessness ==without addressing the housing market== is like trying to ==towel a floor dry when the roof has blown off==.**

Houston’s reasonable-priced market rate housing also helps **people who ==managed to stop being homeless== to stay housed even if their fortunes decline.**
