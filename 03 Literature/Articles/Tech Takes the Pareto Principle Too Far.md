# Tech Takes the Pareto Principle Too Far

> [!abstract] Summary
> An article on the Pareto Principle and how the tech industry has forgotten the value of finishing work to a high degree of polish, since that last 20% of work is comparatively much more effort with low financial incentive.

There’s a reason video games build what’s called a ‘vertical slice’. If you’re not familiar, a vertical slice is a single playable area, with all mechanics, final art, vfx, sfx, music, etc.

The vertical slice is what game developers show publishers and investors to demonstrate not only that the game itself is going to be good, but also that the game development **team has ==all the skills necessary to deliver== the game to the level of polish the market demands.**

Contrast this with the tech industry, which submits for approval an ‘MVP’. **A minimum viable product is the ==absolute least== one can create that ==someone will pay for.**==

The problem is that **MVPs ==don’t actually establish== whether the team ==/could/== get to a ==finished product==**, and in practice many can’t.

Recently, getting VC funding has become such an end in itself that engineers in the **tech industry, centered around Silicon Valley, have ==optimized their skillset for prototyping.**==

What the Pareto Principle doesn’t capture, and what its adherents seem to forget, **is that you ==still HAVE TO DO that last 20%.**== End users usually don’t enjoy using 80% of a website, or driving 80% of a car.

When products remain incomplete it’s often because all potential **==customers have already paid== and there’s ==no financial incentive== to finish.**

However, there is another, more frustrating reason why a product might remain unfinished. **Maybe it’s literally ==impossible to complete.== I think that’s the situation we find ourselves in for certain ==applications of AI**==

The problem is **I ==don’t think== that **the ==current methodology== is capable of taking us the ==other 80/20%== of the way.**

If we **took a ==more craftsmanlike view of software==, we would realize that a ==chair is not 80% done when you can sit on it.**==

So while from a utilitarian standpoint something may have most of the features a person might ask for, from a humanist point of view 20% of the work still only produces 20% of the results.
