# The truth about latchkey kids

> [!abstract] Summary
> An article on Gen X latchkey kids and the real cause for their trauma, divorce. Argues that the danger to children isn't time alone but uncertainty in their home situation, exacerbated by being left unsupervised.
## Highlights

This is a by-now **standard Gen X coping mechanism: treating childhood neglect – in this case, taking care of ourselves after school – as a matter of significant pride**, part of our generational identity.

But whatever pride there may be is often leavened by a great deal of bitterness, usually over absentee parents who (it is thought) put their own needs and priorities ahead of those of their kids.

One of the most amazing anecdotes, in an essay that is largely just a string of amazing anecdotes, involves an aunt coming over and finding the kids scarfing down handfuls of raw pasta.

What is interesting about Phetasy’s piece, in many ways, is just how unremarkable it is — the I-was-abandoned-by-my-divorced-parents has been its own genre of Gen X lit for a while now.

rise of what became known as ==**“latchkey kids”== — children who return home after school and are left unsupervised** until a parent comes home from work.  There was widespread concern about the situation at the time, and the received wisdom was that it was on the whole a bad thing.

By the early 1990s, there were something like 3.5 million latchkey kids in the U.S., or seven per cent of those between the ages of 5 and 13.

But interestingly, **there is ==no clear link== to be found between being a ==latchkey kid and social or emotional damage.==** It is true, one study found that latchkey children showed more hyperactivity and certain types of misbehaviour than kids who came home to a parent or other adult caregiver. But **th==ese effects disappeared== when the researchers ==controlled for emotional support and for income.==**

latchkey children did about as well, socially and emotionally, as their peers who received adult supervision following the end of the school day.

That is, **it isn’t ==whether kids are alone or not==, it’s ==what they are up to when alone==, and whether there is any monitoring, support, and discipline.**

This makes intuitive sense. There is a world of difference between a kid coming home after school to find a note from a parent on the counter that says “dinner is on the stove, I’ll be home at 5:30” versus a kid who comes home to an empty fridge and no sense of when anyone will be home, and is left to fend for themself.

according to one study, **many kids found the ==alone time after school to be empowering.==** They liked the solitude and the responsibility,

Which brings us full circle, and back to what seems, for many Gen Xers, to be the source of the real trauma – their parents’ divorce. One of the more disturbing aspects of Phetasy’s article is not the details of her and her siblings’ neglect, or even how damaged she was as a child by the divorce, but how much of it she is still carrying with her.

Ultimately, the long term consequences of all this will be borne out by how Gen Xers have ended up parenting their own kids. **==If our parents sinned through neglect, are we simply making the opposite error, by overcorrecting?==**

Julie Lythcott-Haims wrote a piece for _Time_ that described the precise moment the scales fell from her eyes: After a long day spent trying to convince helicopter parents to back off and leave their kids to experience college on their own, she sat down at the dinner table and instinctively reached over to start cutting her kids’ meat: “_If you want your kid to be independent at 18, at some point you have to stop cutting their meat._ I sat bolt upright. **==_When do you stop cutting their meat?”_==**
