# **The only computer science book worth reading twice?**

> [!abstract] Summary
> A post praising the Computer Science textbook SICP from 1984. Though dated this book still offers essential insights into the fundamentals of Computer Science, especially in regards to its underlying nature.
### **Highlights**
---
> **==_Structure and interpretation of computer programs_==** by Hal Abelson and Jerry Sussman (MIT Press. 1984. ISBN 0-262-01077-1), also known as _SICP_.

> Hal and Jerry **view everything as an ==exercise in language design==**

> approach of stratified design, the notion that **a complex system should be structured as ==a sequence of levels== that are ==described using a sequence of languages.**==

> **Layered abstraction** of course is second nature to all computer scientists. What’s novel in this **view is that each level should be _programmable_**

> The computer revolution is a ==**revolution== in the ==way we think== and in the ==way we express what we think.==**

> ==**Mathematics**== provides a framework f**or dealing precisely with notions of ==“what is.”**== ==**Computation**== provides a framework for **dealing precisely with notions of ==“how to."==**

> SICP is to computer science what Feynman’s _Lectures on Physics_ are to physics: **an ==accessible distillation of the essence== of the subject** that’s stood the test of time.
