# fast

> [!abstract] Summary
> In praise of fast software, which is only possible when those making it are pursuing technical excellence. To make software fast it must be opinionated, disciplined and focused.
## Highlights
---
But **software that's fast changes behavior.**  
  
**==Developers ship more often when code deploys in seconds==** (or milliseconds) instead of minutes.  
  
**Fast ==eliminates cognitive friction.**== ... Superhuman's sub-100ms rule—plus their focus on keyboard shortcuts—changed the email game in a way that no one's been able to replicate, let alone beat. I recently used Mercury to pay another business that uses Mercury, and its instant settle felt surprising in a world where bank transfers usually take days. 
  
**Fast signals ==simplicity**==, which is even rarer in a world where code and content are commodities.  
  
**Fast software has ==nowhere to hide.== Network calls and dependencies reveal themselves through latency, and this ==brutal honesty forces discipline.== Companies that do fast very well ==tend to have very focused products.**==  
  
**This is because ==the effort to make software fast often requires stripping away non-essential features**.== Compare how fast a streamlined project management tool like Linear loads versus an enterprise app like Workday (or worse… Oracle). In a world obsessed with adding rather than refining, speed becomes the ultimate expression of respect. **It says, "We've thought deeply about what matters and ==eliminated everything else.=="**  
  
In order to make things fast, you often have to do complex things behind the scenes. ... In this interview, Kevin Systrom explains how Instagram _optimistically uploaded_ users' photos while they entered their caption to make the upload experience feel instant. **Fast isn't just a technical accomplishment—==it signals prioritization and focus.** ==
