[[Learning Systems Thinking]]
# Preface

> [!abstract] Summary
> Montalion sets the tone and the philosophy of the book. The idea that the fields of technology and communication are one and the same. The Internet has become so complicated as to be outside the scope of a single individual and therefore it requires communication with others, both literal and software, for anything to succeed. This communication is facilitated by changing from linear thinking to the nonlinear process of thinking in systems.

### Highlights

9
> It became apparent that **==communications and computing served each other== so intimately that they might actually become the same thing.**
> —Tracy Kidder, The Soul of a New Machine (Little, Brown and Company)

10
> Beauty, she said, depends on our geography.

> Who you were, authentically, mattered. In winter, getting up the mountain to home mattered. (Learning to put chains on your tires so you didn’t slide off the mountain mattered.)

11
>Still, when I remember Missoula, I remember beauty.

> Within a month, I had moved into Second Life, a virtual world of endless... enjoyment? Creativity? Time squandering? I rediscovered being plugged in.

> Missoula evenings became less about reading books; mornings became less about writing. I refilled my coffers from digital oceans. **I surfed. Increasingly, ==I connected with people elsewhere.== The rich beauty, the endless possibility, of ==Montana faded==** into the (boring) distance.

12
> **==Writing or programming?==** I was the only “techie” I knew in Missoula, which felt increasingly frustrating. The digital world was speeding up—I could hardly keep up from the middle of the forest.

13
> Meanwhile, the world around us—the internet—was growing into the complex information graph it was perhaps never intended to be. Less about a document, or web page, and more about the **==relationships== among all information**.

14
> The **==complexity== of everything** has increased.

> Technology is everywhere; everything is technology; everyone is involved. **==Technologists are learning to speak every language==—tech, marketing, business, product—simultaneously.**

15
> That transformation—from thinking in software to ==thinking in systems==—is an **iceberg almost ==every initiative hits==. And when they fail,** transformation initiatives don’t just sink, they sink spectacularly.

> The skills we need no longer fit the stereotypical Lone Supernerd coding while eating pizza at 2 a.m. **==No one can do it alone.== Technology skills (alone) are not enough.**

> We don’t think in systems. **To move from software to systems, we need to ==think differently (together).**==

15-16
> The choice I made in Montana, **a ==career in communication== or a ==career in technology==, was not, and should never have been viewed as, a dichotomy.** My journey from nowhere to everywhere, from software to systems, has led me to **one inevitable conclusion: ==technology design is communication design==.**

> Organizations, who design systems, are constrained to produce **designs which are ==copies of the communication== structures of these organizations.**
> —Conway’s Law

> **==We build what we think==. We structure thinking through communication**, and then we craft it into something actionable. Communication is how we think together.

17
> Because **==everything is a system==**. Everywhere we are part of those systems.
> We need to think in and communicate about systems.
