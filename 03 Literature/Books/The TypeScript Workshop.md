##### Completion Checklist
###### I. To Become Dark
- [x] Write the Book title in the heading.
- [ ] Complete all the metadata except `tags`.
- [x] Complete the `Citation` section.
- [x] Add tag `status/dark`.
###### II. From Dark to Dawn
- [x] In the `Index` section add each chapter to the list, following the structure of the book.
- [ ] Chapter by chapter link the `Index` chapter names to the corresponding chapter note. Do this as you read not all at once.
- [ ] Make sure all the chapter notes are complete.
- [ ] Update status to `status/dawn`
###### III. From Dawn to Day
- [ ] Write the book `Summary`.
- [ ] Complete the `Main Point`, treat it as an interpretation of the book, or maybe your learnings. It differs from the `Summary` in that it is not a rephrasing of the book but your own original understanding of it.
- [ ] Fill in the context tags for the metadata.
- [ ] Update status tag to `status/day`.
- [ ] Remove this checklist.
