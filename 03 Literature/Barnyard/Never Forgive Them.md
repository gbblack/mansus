# Never Forgive Them

Big Tech (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, ... ) has made our digital lives a nightmare. In pursuit of fiscal growth they abuse their users through malicious design, endless frustrations and outright coercion to extract as much money or "value" from their users.
The online world is no longer optional and the damage this causes to the mental and social wellbeing of its users is massive, **we must never forgive them for it.**

> I will never forgive these people for what they’ve done to the computer, and the more I learn about both their intentions and actions the more certain I am that they are unrepentant and that their greed will never be sated. I have watched them take the things that made me human — social networking, digital communities, apps, and the other connecting fabric of our digital lives — and turned them into devices of torture, profitable mechanisms of abuse, and find it disgusting how many reporters seem to believe it's their responsibility to thank them and explain why it's good this is happening to their readers.

> The forces I criticize see no beauty in human beings. They do not see us as remarkable things that generate ideas both stupid and incredible, they do not see talent or creativity as something that is innately human, but a commodity to be condensed and monetized and replicated so that they ultimately own whatever value we have, which is the kind of thing you’d only believe was possible (or want) if you were fully removed from the human race.
