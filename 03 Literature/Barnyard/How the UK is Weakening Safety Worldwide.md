# How the UK is Weakening Safety Worldwide

The UK ordered Apple to put a backdoor in their iCloud encryption. Apple refused to do this, instead they removed encryption for all UK users.
This is one example in a pattern of regulations designed to increase online "safety", but reality shows they further eradicate our right to privacy.

I can’t help but wonder what sort of world we’re leaving them where they have no freedom to explore and grow, where they’re forever haunted by their mistakes in a digital permanent record, where the only thing standing between their freedom of expression and a fear of self-exploration is policy and not real, technical safeguards that make such abuse impossible. Protecting people is admirable, and we should take all reasonable measures we can to do so. Banning encryption is neither reasonable nor protecting people. It’s actively putting them at risk.
