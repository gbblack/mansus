# I'm an American software developer and the "broligarchs" don't speak for me

We wouldn’t even need to leave our houses. Easier said than done, I get it. But at the very least, you need to have a line in the sand. I will NEVER intentionally write software that steals information from people or manipulates or hurts them. Where is your line?
