# We don't need startups, we need Digital-Mittelstand

> [!abstract] Summary
## Highlights
---
> Yet, no country has succeeded in creating its own Silicon Valley. Why? Either these leaders fail to grasp the nuances of what made Silicon Valley what it is, or they lack a deep understanding of their own nation’s cultural fabric.

> The reason is simple: Silicon Valley isn’t merely a hub of companies, tax breaks, and venture capital—it’s a unique ecosystem driven by culture. It’s a magnet for individuals from diverse backgrounds united by one shared ambition: make a dent in the universe.

> n Germany, the cultural landscape is strikingly different. Few people are driven by the ambition to “change the world”—perhaps because they feel they’ve already contributed their share as a nation.

> However, if you’ve ever used a product marked “Made in Germany,” you’ll understand what German culture truly values: mastery of a craft and uncompromising quality.

> They’re not the kind to release half-baked products and patch issues later, nor are they likely to push for higher prices just to fatten shareholders’ returns. The average German—apart from those who’ve left the country and morphed into “tech bros”—isn’t particularly moved by shareholder value, especially when the Basic Law of Germany begins with “Human dignity shall be inviolable.” The entire culture fundamentally opposes many hallmarks of the typical startup ethos.

> If you’re unfamiliar with Mittelstand, it refers to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany. While there’s no formal definition, these companies typically have fewer than 500 employees and annual revenues under 50 million Euro.

> What sets Mittelstand apart from SMEs in other countries, however, is their laser-sharp focus on a single niche, in which they excel. A significant portion of their income comes from exporting high-quality goods.

> By catering to super-specific markets with few competitors worldwide, demand for their products remains steady, no matter the economic climate.

> If you’ve ever worked with Mittelstand companies, you’ll know that many have a long queue of customers waiting for their products. It’s not uncommon to wait months—or even years—for an order. Yet customers are willing to wait because they know these businesses either produce the best quality or are the only ones making the product at all. This dedication to quality and niche expertise explains why Mittelstand accounts for around 30% of Germany’s exports.

> The challenge, however, is that Mittelstand companies primarily focus on physical goods. Unlike major tech giants, they can’t enjoy the massive profit margins of producing digital products with zero marginal costs.

> While startups often begin with a focus on creating a minimum viable product (MVP), they tend to evolve into growth-hungry, investment-driven machines. Consider Spotify: it started as a music streaming service but has since expanded into podcasts and audiobooks. Netflix, synonymous with video streaming, has now ventured into gaming. This expansive growth strategy stands in stark contrast to Mittelstand’s ethos, which centers on focus, mastery, and sustainability. Mittelstand companies prioritize doing one thing exceptionally well, guided by a core ideology of longevity and conservative, long-term financial planning.

> Most startups are built with the goal of either being acquired by a tech giant or going public. Mittelstand, however, aims to create lasting value for customers and employees—not shareholders. Startups also demand extreme dedication, often expecting employees to work 60–80 hours a week with little regard for work-life balance. In Mittelstand, employee well-being is a priority, encouraging a healthier balance between work and personal life. Even in today’s highly competitive AI industry, the startup world thrives on cutthroat competition. Mittelstand, by contrast, operates in niche markets with limited competition due to their specialized products.

> Given these cultural and structural differences, I believe the traditional startup model won’t work in Germany. Instead of chasing a Silicon Valley model that no other country has successfully replicated, Germany should focus on developing the Digital-Mittelstand. This concept seamlessly aligns with both the German cultural ethos and the digital economy.

> Creating a digital product doesn’t require massive capital investment—a small team of a designer and a developer can be enough to launch something meaningful. With fewer employees, companies can prioritize long-term goals, refine their product iteratively, and maintain lean operational costs. Once the product gains traction, the zero-marginal-cost nature of digital products allows them to scale without incurring significant additional expenses. Unlike startups that prioritize rapid growth or shareholder appeasement, Digital-Mittelstand companies can focus on work-life balance. If they generate enough revenue to cover expenses and fund leisure activities, that’s often sufficient for many Germans—a stark contrast to the high-pressure growth culture of Silicon Valley.

> This model also aligns perfectly with Germany’s geographic and cultural diversity. Consider Germany’s population distribution compared to Turkey, for example. Both countries have similar populations (around 85 million), but even Gaziantep—my hometown and the sixth-largest city in Turkey—has a higher population (2.2 million) than Hamburg, the second most populous city (1.8 million) in Germany. This balanced distribution, which mirrors the Mittelstand’s industry diversification, contributes to Germany’s economic resilience. In contrast, the most populous city in Turkey, Istanbul’s dominance of Turkey’s economy (30% of the GDP) creates a single point of failure, especially with the looming risk of a major earthquake. A similar risk exists in highly centralized economies like London’s (25%).

> Many Mittelstand employees live in small cities near their companies’ facilities. Digital-Mittelstand, however, can leverage remote work to further reduce costs. Employees could live in small towns, enjoy lower living expenses, and maintain a high quality of life thanks to Germany’s good transportation infrastructure. Remote work also translates into lower personnel costs, typically the largest expense for any startup. By tapping into these advantages, Digital-Mittelstand could achieve both profitability and sustainability without compromising employee well-being.

> These are just a few examples, and many can be classified under Software as a Service (SaaS). While these products don’t require massive capital investments, they do rely heavily on expertise. By focusing on niche markets and high-quality offerings, Digital-Mittelstand companies can carve out profitable, sustainable businesses. With minimal competition and zero-marginal-cost scalability, this model offers a long-term, balanced approach to growth and innovation.
