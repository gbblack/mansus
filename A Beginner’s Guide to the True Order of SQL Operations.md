# A Beginner’s Guide to the True Order of SQL Operations

> [!abstract] Summary
## Highlights
---
> The SQL language is very intuitive. Until it isn’t. Over the years, a lot of people have criticised the SQL language for a variety of reasons. For instance: IDEs cannot easily guess what auto completion options to offer

> These things are weird, because the _lexical_ order of operations does not match the _logical_ order of operations.

> All the different SQL clauses have extremely complex interdependencies.
