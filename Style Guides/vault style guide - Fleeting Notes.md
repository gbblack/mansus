### How to take a Fleeting Note

##### What are Fleeting Notes?

These notes will actually exist mostly entirely outside my vault. These are notes that contain my first impression, or initial thoughts. They are, like their name suggests, ephemeral and temporary. The insight you capture in a fleeting note must be passed into another before the context leaves you. This passing in of notes and context are the fleeting notes that will exist in this vault.

This way even though the time where the fleeting note occurred is in the far past I can jump right in to developing it as the initial impression is captured.

##### How do I take Fleeting Notes?

Collecting and parsing Fleeting Notes is the first step in creating my vault. Unlike all other types of notes these will have no standards ascribed to them. No formatting to keep ot metadata to manage. These notes are useful as they are spontaneous, simple and scattered.

An example are the line underlined in a book you're reading, or adding an article you want to read to a list, they are idle thoughts theown onto a file in the middle of the workday, they are all to be processed later, in a different moment. But not too late, either the same day or week that the note was made. These notes should never take you fully out of the present moment, but instead be a record of thought from the day.

On a seperate occasion these notes are filtered, assigned and given minimal context. 

You should only give as much context as you need as a starting off point, for example if you link an article include in `()` why it spiked your interest. If you underline a section of a book include a few words of your initial impression.

Once recorded they are complete, no further work necesary.
