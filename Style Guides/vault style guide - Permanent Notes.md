### How to take a Permanent Note

##### What is a Permanent Note?

A Permanent Note is the final shape of one's thoughts over a topic. It is defined by being made up entirely by your own writing and thought. in this note there is your own understanding and thoughts on the subject. When the note references another to make its point it is either a Literature Note or another Permanent Note. These notes are successful when they are completely understood without needing any additional context. 

In this way they are also called atomic notes, anyone at any time should be able to read a Permanent Note and understand what is being said. They also should remain short, in the best case short enough to fit on an index card if it were handwritten. 

These notes are the physical representation of your understanding on a topic and as such by their nature when the note is complete and in good condition, so is you understanding of this topic. You can consider the knowledge here fully digested.

This is because as time passes and you forget the contents or implications of this note, your vault will not. It will be here waiting and when you call it back up it will deliver its knowledge fully contained and digestible for easy understanding. It works becuase YOU wrote it, and when you wrote it this knowledge has been passed over and distilled down to its absolute essential elements according to YOUR understanding. 
##### How do I take a Permanent Note?

These notes are the least intuitive, I think, to make. Since they rely on nothing but your own interpretations and understandings they have no obvious jumping off point. In other notes you are referencing outside information, which is a great place to start. In this one you acess and refer only to internal thought and information.

As such to make even your first note you will need several other types of notes to begin the process, mostly Literature Notes. Considering its somewhat hard to grasp, nature these notes are best "discovered" while in the process of other things. Like Fleeting Notes the topics that will become Permanent Notes can and should come to you at any time. Maybe you've read and noted a lot of work about compilers and decide to write your own note. These notes do not have to be original, in fact I would say they shouldn't be. Writing them should be a test of the entire workflow. If I can assemble a handful of notes and from there write a new original note where I reiterate the related points from the literature into its own new note and that note is understandable, succinct and accurate? The I can confidently say that the knowledge I am expressing is thoroughly understood.
