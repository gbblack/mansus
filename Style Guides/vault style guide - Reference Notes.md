### How to take a Reference Note

##### What is a Reference Note?

Reference Notes are any notes that include little to no interpretation, these are used to store factual static information so that they can be referenced.

Similar to cheat sheets for programming syntax or vocabulary. A reference note should read like a glossary holding concepts and their definitions. Meant for quick look ups of material rather than thorough thinking.
##### How do I take Reference Notes?

A reference note needs little formatting, just enough metadata to be toed to its corresponding area and topic and then placing all the items and their definitions in a list or table.

The definitions should include just the barebones meaning and purpose, if further explanation is possible/worthwhile, the definition should link to a separate new Permanent Note that reflects my understanding of the item.

An example would be a Rust reference note that contains `cargo` commands and in the definition you shouldn't include any details beyond what Cargo is and instead link to the Cargo note.
