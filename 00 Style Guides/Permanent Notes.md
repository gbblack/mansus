# Permanent Notes

### What is a Permanent Note?

Permanent Notes are the goal of this vault. These are notes written on a singular granular topic. These notes are written entirely from your own understanding of the given topic. The important distinction for this vault is that these notes aren't only for new thought, but also for your personal understanding of a an idea. 

If I have a permanent note on the Quick Sort algorithm there shouldn't be anything new in it. Instead it should be a mix of the factual and my understanding of it. All the writing should be in my own words and be sourced from existing literature notes. Consider them records of your understanding.

Since these notes are uniquely yours they bear some semi regular review whenever new information has been brought to a topic but otherwise they are quite informal. 
You could even think of each note a s a blog post on the topic. Write them as if you are teaching the topic to the reader, include all the context and be explicit while keeping it short.

These notes should host links to related material, creating the networked affect that makes Zettelkasten so powerful. Once a collection of these have been made then insights can be derived from where they intersect and from there your understanding goes from being an audience to this learning to a participant.
### How do I take a Permanent Note?

Currently I have no place or ideas for structuring this class of notes. They will all vary widely and fundamentally only need to meet two criteris:
1. Be written entirely in your own words, using your own understanding.
2. Keep them concise, you need to be able to hold the entirety of the note in your brain easily.

If a notes topic is too large, break it down and link them. Use index notes to organise them for better search-ability and navigation.
