# Workflow Decisions
---

I want to create a consistent look and approach across all notes so that when I'm writing them all the decisions on how things should look/be structured has been decided already and I only need to think about the material itself.

While the templates are a great start there are still decisions/processes that need to be made to achieve the desired result.

- **Linter:** For actual textual styling, such as the spacing between lines or periods at the end of a list item. I need to create a linter that can catch and implement all that for me. (There is a plugin to help with this)
- **Templates:** For each template, there should be a checklist of what steps need to be taken to "complete" the note. These are up for change as I'm still figuring things out.
- **Purpose:** How to approach a note depends on what you're trying to get from it. There should be guides/templates for helping notes that serve different purposes. i.e. learning vs. discussion vs. reference.
- **DECIMAL:** A detailed accounting of how I've structured my DECIMAL system and why. As well as a more robust template for the DECIMAL tag files that will be storesd here and how they can be used.
- **Frontmatter:** The frontmatter needs to be limited, purposeful and focused on search-ability. Optimised for querying through Dataview and as such should hold info relevant to the meta of the note and not its contents.
- **Linking:** When making links be liberal. In the case of learning we need as much overlap as possible to click around a topic easily. Linking should only occur from your own words/paraphrasing. No linking topics from within a quote. If a permanent note uses a literature note as evidence for its ideas we can create a backlink after the fact.
- **Inbox:** Need to think more on how I want my vault structured, Inbox currently should hold all WIP notes to leave the sidebar clutter free. This still needs some use before I can tell if its a good idea or not.
- **Reference:** A better distinction and understanding for what a reference note is and how I want to use them needs to be made. Are they simply cheat sheets for a topic? A table of facts? Guides? Tutorials? Exercises?
- **Audio/Video:** Need to decide how I want to include these media types into the vault. No idea on how to tackle these sorts or learning materials.
- **Permanent:** The Holy Grail of this project. By their nature they take awhile to occur as you first need to collect, digest and think on outside influences before writing one of these. As such I have no idea what these are gonna look like or how I will be approaching them.
