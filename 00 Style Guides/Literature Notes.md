# Literature Notes

### What is a Literature Note?

Literature  Notes are the cornerstone of all thinking. They are the bridge of understanding between you and the source material. These notes are where we take in outside information and begin to internalise it, in the hopes of achieving understanding.

There are many types of literature notes, to match the many types of media we can consume. Each needs to be broken down and engaged with slightly differently. You cannot read a textbook with the same focus as a novel.

A Literature Note, for my purposes, should contain only outside ideas and be easily reviewable. The writing in these notes should be dedicated to the source through highlights or paraphrasing essential material in bullet points.

By far these will take the longest. They require repetition, focus and active thought. They also require trust. Trust in myself that I will not be losing all that I don't highlight. When engaging with a source, take what speaks to you or is factual, everything else can be left behind. Trust that your intuition is right.
### How do I write Literature Notes?

This vault is inspired by Luhmann's Zettelkasten but it differs greatly in purpose. A Zettelkasten is specialised for insight, Luhmann's slipbox is amazing for discovering insights in a replicable consistent way. However this vault is dedicated to learning. The techniques I'm using to write and engage with these notes are still being worked on. 

The process for breaking down text, as defined [[How to Read a Hard Book|here]], can be applied to all writing. The difficult to implement process are for sources that cannot be read, such as audio or video. 

I have not decided how I'm going to takle those sources, for now I'll need to practice and see what works.

Literature notes are also ill suited for digesting practice, things such as tutorials, guides or exercises. These types of learning should be recorded and engaged with differently.
