1. Focus on it chapter by chapter.
2. Read each chapter in its entirety uninterrupted.
3. Take a 5 min break.
4. Re read chapter, underline/highlight the factual parts and whatever strikes your interest. Maybe include a quick thought.
5. Go over those notes and create a chapter summary, in writing on paper.

Make a mind map of the chapter (for practice):
1. Find all the keywords in a chapter
2. split them into groups according to main and subtopics
3. plot them on the page with these things in mind:
   - how do they relate?
   - how are they similar/different?
   - cause and effect?
   - parts vs whole?
4. When plotting a mind map use visuals as much as possible while keeping word count low, you need it to be quick to parse and images speak 1000 words.
#### Idea 1 for tackling a textbook

1. Create an index note for the entire textbook, give it the name of the book and inside include a bibliography format.
2. Read the Table of contents and see how the book is structured.
3. Create a note for the first chapter. Write a Literature Note and make a Mindmap for chapter 1 in this note. Include a aummary of the chapter, in your own words.
4. Do this for every chapter.
5. Link all the chapter Notes into the index
6. Create a textbook wide mind map? (maybe)
