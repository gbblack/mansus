### How to take a Literature Note

##### What is a Literature Note?

A Literature Note is any Note taking in the words/thoughts of another person or source. They are the notes taken on a book, article, video, podcast and so on.

Literature Notes are often born from, but not always, [[vault style guide - Fleeting Notes|Fleeting Notes]]. In the Fleeting Note we might have underlines an interesting sentence in a book, or have highlighted an entire paragraph graph in an article.

Whatever the case a Literature Note is where the second step of distillation occurs.

##### How do I write Literature Notes?

Literature Notes will have a `status` property denoting how "complete" it is. Once the note reaches the status of `Dusk` the note can be considered finished and therefore be "sunsetted" as a full addition to my second brain.

To reach the `Dusk` status we must first pass through the other three:
- `Night`: the earliest stage, when the relavent fleeting notes have been dumped into the Literature Note. Initial impressions might be included here but only barebones examples.
- `Dawn`: the second stage, where interpretation occurs, here the quote or ideas that spoke to me most are formatted in a quote block and benesth, in my own words, is my interpretation of them.
- `Noon`: penultimate stage, here I pour over my own thoughts and the original quotes. Using the distillation methods from [[PARA]] I **bold** and then ==highlight== the most important insights from this thinking. Finally I check that I've kept to my styling and formatting app/playwright/playwright-report, completed the metadata and tagged appropriately. 

Only once every stage is complete can this note graduate to the `Dusk` status.

##### Formatting Standards

For the Literature Note, as it is a mix between your own and others' thinking there should be a clear divide of authorship at a glance.

All external writing should be in block quote format.
Above the block should be the page number the quote excerpt is on.
Or the timestamp if its an audio/visual medium.
For articles place nothing.

At the footer of the note should be proper citations in case formal references are needed.

-> could be an actual block rather than a Footer, will need to check what looks better.
