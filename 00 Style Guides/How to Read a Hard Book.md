# Thinking About Reading

This vault is designed for promoting learning above all else. As such Literature Notes are the cornerstone of this project. I wish to learn many things and to read many books to learn them. However the type of text matters when translating and digesting it into notes.
### Textbooks

A textbook requires a lot of work to understand. Its purpose is to convey dense factual information of a topic to the reader, as such it requires slower more thoughtful engagement to turn its dense pages into easily reviewable sections.

Here is my strategy below, extremely new and open to change:
1. Make an index note of the textbook who's name is the title, this should be stored in `Literature/Books`.
2. Fill in the index and link to the books chapter notes, named as such `title-#` with the `#` being the chapter number. Introductions or prefaces are `00`. In the case a chapter needs to be split into two notes we can add a letter: `00a`.
3. Each chapter should only link back to the index, and contain no contextual tags.
4. The index note should hold all the link and tags that reference the book.
5. Once complete the chapter note should be stored in `Literature/Books/Chapters`.

More granular steps to take for each note is within their templates.
##### Additions

As this whole process is still very new there are elements that could be valuable for learning that may enter the workflow, such as:
- Mind maps
- Cornell notes
- Questions and answer approach

### Literature

In the case of actual literature books these are simpler to break down. Depending on their size we might not even need to split them into chapters. For these books it is important to take highlights and distil them before paraphrasing. The learning happens here from reading the text multiple times and thinking on how to reduce it to its essential summary.

These texts also benefit from the Feynman technique, where you "teach" the material to yourself.

More details are written in the templates.
