# A write up for organising my life and files using the Johnny.Decimal System

Original Source: https://johnnydecimal.com/10-19-concepts/11-core/11.01-introduction/

Goal here is design a system for storing, archiving and logging my life/knowledge that I can carry with me from computer to computer and into the real world.

For my Areas I'm going to rank them from 1 - 9 based on how often I imagine they will be updated. 0 is reserved for Meta regarding the system itself.

Areas:

00-09 System Meta
01-19 Projects
20-29 Github
30-39 Cooking
40-49 Media
50-59 Life Admin

---
#### 00-09 System Meta

Tis area contains any and everything related to the system itself as well as a staging area for things that are unfinished or not decided on

00 Meta - this holds the Index for the entire system
11 Inbox - for files related to things that haven't been addressed yet
12 Bookmarks - links, files, topics anything i think is interesting I want to take a look at later that isn't a file already in the system otherwise that goes into Inbox
13 To Dos - common todo files for repeated tasks, such as to to dos to complete a literature note, or maybe the things needed to be done to consider an edited video complete.
09 Archive
#### 10-19 Projects

This area will contain all my non dev work and projects. currently bare but hopefully will grow over time. Will contain an archive for completed projects, like one that is "looking for a house".

10 Meta
11 Writing
12 Goals
13 Shared - continaing public projects that other people will contribute to
14 Templates - contains templates for things, like a blank presentation or proposal plan
19 Archive
#### 20-29 Github

For this Area I'm splitting the ten categories into the discipline or sections I think I will be working/learning in. A lot of the projects on here will be to practice the categories discipline.

13 Backend - for backend only project (APIs, datacases)
14 CLI Tools
15 Games

17 Snippets - for coding practice like leetcode or rustlinga
18 Other People - github repos cloned from another profile

#### 40-49 Media

This Area will contain all me files that are media, so books, articles, paper, music, videos, photos, reference images, screenshots, presentations and an archive. This holds a lthan other areas, say an image of my passport, that would go in the Life Admin Area. This is more for memory.
