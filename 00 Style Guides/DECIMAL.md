# DECIMAL: Digital Archive of My Entire Life

This is a Work In Progress. As I collect more files and consolidate those I already have the structure of this DECIMAL system is likely to change. 

This file should eventually hold my final design for how I will be storing all my digital files into one folder using the Johnny Decimal system. My goal is to create a robust organisational structure that doesn't change much through my life so that I may carry it from computer to computer by moving only a single folder.

This system does not include applications or their files, this is for personal files, record keeping, media storing and to improve my digital hygiene.

First we split my life into at most 10 areas labelled 00-09:

00-09 System Meta
01-19 Projects
20-29 Github
30-39 Cooking
40-49 Media
50-59 Life Admin

Each area is split into another at most 10 categories, I will be reserving the 0 numbers for meta information and the 9 for archives.

#### 00-09 System Meta

This area holds all files related to the system itself. Currently empty and not sure how I wish to use it.
#### 10-19 Projects

This area will hold non programming projects, this Mansus lives in category 11. Hence the name.
included in the scope of projects are long form tasks, such as "Looking for a new house", "Digitising all my CDs" or "Scrapbooking all my letters". Any files related to the ongoing project should live here, but once its complete move all temp files to the Archive and rearrange any permanent materials to their new place in the DECIMAL system.

10 Projects Meta
11 Mansus
19 Projects Archive
#### 20-29 GitHub

This area will contain all my GitHub repositories, both clones and original. The categories are currently split up by topic but most certainly likely to change.

20 GitHub Meta
21 Web Dev
22 CLI
25 Games
28 Snippets
29 GitHub Archive
#### 30-39 Cooking

This are is for all my cooking related knowledge. Recipes, meal tracking, ingredient details, conversions. Could become its own category in Projects rather than an area. We'll see.

30 Cooking Meta
31 Recipes
32 Ingredients
33 Techniques
34 Tools - notes on items, their manuals and care instructions
35 Utilities - notes on things I look up often such as temperature conversions
#### 40-49 Media

This area is to hold all my media files, of any kind. So long as something is not part of an application it should live here. By far will be the largest area and see the most use. 

This is also what the DECIMAL files from this vault will be referencing. They each correspond to an ID in this area so that I don't have to store source files in Obsidian. 

40 Media Meta
41 Literature
42 Images
43 Video
44 Audio
45 Mixed Media
49 Media Archive
#### 50-59 Life Admin

This Area is Me. In here are all the things relevant to living my life. My bills, my payslips, recurring documents for administrative purposes.

50 Life Meta
51 Money
52 Domino
53 Health
59 Life Archive
