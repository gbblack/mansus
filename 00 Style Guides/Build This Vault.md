# Vault Build
### Frontmatter
---
In each template there will be the relevant frontmatter included:
- `tags`: For context and meta.
- `created`: Date the note was created.
- `source`: Link to original source or DECIMAL location.
- `author`
- `publication`

In the tags we have two meta tags: `status` and `type`.
##### Status
The status tags display how "complete" a note is. There are 3 explicit statuses and one implicit.

The first and implicit status is no status at all, all [[vault style guide - Fleeting Notes|Fleeting Notes]] fall into this category. Until real work begins no status is added.

The three status states are:
- `Dark`: This a first pass over a material or idea.
- `Dawn`: This status is for when major work has been done but it is still incomplete.
- `Day`: This is for when a note can be thought of as finished, you shouldn't be actively working on notes of this status.
##### Type
These tags are simply to show what kind of note it is, mostly for querying purposes using Dataview. Will look like this: `type/book`, `type/article` and so on.
