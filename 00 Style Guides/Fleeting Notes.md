# Fleeting Notes
### What are Fleeting Notes?

Fleeting Notes is the start of every single note. They are without structure or template as they are simply the first step in taking outside information and bringing them here into the Mansus.

These notes, unlike all the rest, serve no specific purpose. A post it reminding me of an appointment is a fleeting note. Every scribble in my notebook is a fleeting note. Every underline, highlight, copy pasted fact or stat are all fleeting notes.

These are best kept unpreserved outside the vault in writing. The largest amount of thinking should happen here in the fleeting notes in writing on paper, not in the Mansus.

Once a fleeting note approaches a more polished state we can raise it to a digital note, of any kind.
### How do I take Fleeting Notes?

As mentioned above fleeting notes are taken mostly by hand, these written notes hold my first impressions of a topic; my attempts at a summary, my initial goal planning. 
It is critical that they are flexible, portable and short. I have a notebook that is not precious to me, when it is complete I will throw it out, because all the notes inside, if they were important, will have been brought in to the Mansus by then.

Taking 5 mins at the end of a day to review all your scribbles and carry them into this vault or to leave them is all that's needed. The critical component of this process is timing. Fleeting notes are only valuable if you still remember the context you took them in, if you scribble a date and time on a paper and then leave it for 2 weeks you are unlikely to remember what it is alluding to. These notes must be decided upon within 3 or 4 days at most of their creation. Many small touches is the only way to succeed with this separation of physical and digital notes.
