> I initially found this article in the archive of the website Anarchist Library but the original is actually an article from Harper's Magazine referencing chapter 12 of the authors' book: *From the Dawn of Everything*.

> British anthropologist named A. M. Hocart proposed that monarchs and institutions of government were originally derived from rituals designed to channel powers of life from the cosmos into human society. He suggested that “the first kings must have been dead kings,” and that individuals so honored only really became sacred rulers at their funerals.

Here in the beginning of the article the authors present the idea that in the beginning of human society structures of governance, and the individuals who ran them, were born not from the necessities of life but from trying to preserve life after death. Later in the introduction it states that recent archeological findings prove Hocart right and that the oldest burials in history seem to have raised people into royalty only after their deaths through burying them with great wealth.

> When Europeans first encountered North American societies, the only kings that existed were ritualistic play kings. If they overstepped the line, their subjects were always free to ignore them or move someplace else. The same went for any other system of authority. A police force that operated for only three months of the year and whose membership rotated annually was, in a certain sense, a play police force—which makes it slightly less bizarre that their members were sometimes recruited from the ranks of ritual clowns.

This ritualisation, the article goes on, extends beyond monarchy and into other facets of governance, such as the ideas of property or policing. This is because in early societies the power inherent to a king or police force belonged truly to the people who placed them there and not the station itself. The moment the king went against the people, the power, who made him they could just as easily remove him. The same logic stretched to other governance aspects, such as policing in this quote; as a ceremonial position the power is firmly held in the hands of the audience of this performance, not the performer.

> Existing debates almost invariably begin with terms derived from Roman law, which conceive of freedom as based on the power of the individual (by implication, a male head of household) to dispose of his property as he sees fit. It is a blunt reality that someone in possession of a thing can do anything he wants with it, except that which is limited “by force or law.” Jurists have struggled with this formulation ever since, as it implies that freedom is essentially a state of primordial exception to the legal order. It also implies that property is not a set of understandings between people about who gets to possess things, but rather a relation between a person and an object of absolute power.

Here the article tries to explain why this shift in power has occurred from the time of our earliest ancestors to now. It goes on to refer to the precedent that Roman law created and enforces on us still this idea that freedom is only allowed so long as the *law* allows it. Making it an exception to the order of *lawful* things. In the case of the Romans this law is based on the absolute power of an individual over something rather than from the consensus of the collective.

> An answer is suggested by the sociologist Orlando Patterson, who points out that conceptions of property (and hence of freedom) in Roman law can be traced back to slave law. It is possible to imagine property as a relationship of domination between a person and thing because, in Roman law, the power of the master rendered the slave a thing, not a person with rights or legal obligations. (...) The very word “family” shares a root with the Latin _famulus,_ meaning “house slave,” via _familia,_ which referred to everyone under the domestic authority of a male head of household.

Here we are shown that the ideas of freedom and property in Roman culture were closely tied. When a Roman is free he can do what he wants to his property, and if he is *not* free then he himself is likely property. This includes being the wife, child or slave of a Roman man.
