**For a technical text:**
###### II. From Dark to Dawn
- [ ] Wait at least 5mins before beginning this section.
- [ ] In the `Note` section breakdown the chapter into its subheading: all the sections in bold.
- [ ] In bullet points, under each section and sub section heading summarise the major points of that section. In these bullet point make links to anything that could be referenced in a permanent note. This will take awhile.
- [ ] While summating the sections copy paste interesting sections into the note under `Highlights`. Include the page number right above the block. These highlights should only be the author's own reflections that you think are interesting, nothing definitive. There may be nothing.
- [ ] Update status tag to `status/dawn`.
###### III. From Dawn to Day

- [ ] Write the chapter `Summary`.
- [ ] Remove or complete the `Nota Bene` as necessary.
- [ ] Fill in the context tags for the metadata.
