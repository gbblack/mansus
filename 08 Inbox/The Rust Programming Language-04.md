# **Understanding Ownership**

> [!abstract] Summary
## **Note**
---
### **What is Ownership?**
- [[Ownership]] is the feature that sets Rust apart. It is what allows for memory safety without garbage collection.
- Ownership is the set of rules Rust uses to govern memory. If any of these rules are broken the code won't compile, which is how Rust can have memory safety.
##### **The Stack and the Heap**
- In Rust understanding the difference between how memory is allocated on the stack vs. the heap is essential as Rust is a systems language.
- Both the stack and heap store memory for code to access at runtime. The difference lies in how they are structured.
- The stack stores values in the order it receives them, and returns them in the opposite order, this is known as *last in first out*.
- Think of the stack as a stack of plates, you both place and grab off the top.
- Adding to the stack is called *pushing* and removing from the stack is *popping*.
- All data on the stack must have a known, fixed size.
- The heap is what it sounds like, a heap of space. When allocating memory to the heap the allocator finds and empty spot big enough to hold the data, marks it as in use and then returns a [[pointer]] which has the address of the location in memory.
- Think of a server at a restaurant guiding your party to a table.
- Pushing onto the stack is faster than allocating to the heap, since the allocator must search for space whereas the stack just adds the data to the top.
- Accessing the data on the stack is faster than the heap too because there's no extra step of following the pointer.
- When code calls a function all the values passed into it, including pointers, get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over they get popped off.
- Ownership addresses all the heap issues such as: keeping track of what code references what address, cleaning up unused data, and minimising duplication.
##### **Ownership Rules**
- There are 3 rules in ownership:
	1. Each value in Rust has an *owner*.
	2. There can only be one owner at a time.
	3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
##### **Variable Scope**
- To understand ownership we need to understand [[scope]], which is the range within a program for which an item is valid.
- Once a variable comes into scope, it is valid. When it goes out of scope the value is dropped and the variable becomes invalid.
##### **The `String` Type**
- The primitive data types are all handled on the stack, as they are always of a know fixed size.
- The `String` is a Rust type that is stored on the heap.
- `String` is different from a string literal (`"example"`) as the literal is immutable.
- To create a `String`from a literal we use the `from` function, `String::from("hello");`.
- The double colon `::` notations allows us to namespace the `from` function under the `String` type rather than using a name like `string_from`.
- The `String` type can be mutated.
##### **Memory and Allocation**
- The reason `String` is mutable whereas a string literal is not it because the literal is hardcoded directly into memory (stack) and is therefore of a know size. The `String` type instead is allocated onto the heap as its size is unknown at compile time.
- In most languages a garbage collector is used to clear up unused memory on the heap, which are difficult to use correctly.
- Rust handles this problem differently, the memory is automatically returned and cleaned once the item that owns it falls out of scope.
- The function that is called to free this memory is `drop`, it is automatically called at the closing curly bracket.

**Variables and Data Interacting with Move**
- In Rust these lines point to the same data on the heap:
  `let s1 = String::from("hello");`
  `let s2 = s1;`
- Under hood `s1` holds three values: a pointer (holding an address to memory), length, and capacity.
- The length is how much memory, in bytes, the `String` is currently using.
- The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, the `String` has received from the allocator.
- When we assign `s1` to `s2` we copy the values that are on the stack, which is the pointer, length and capacity, NOT the values on the heap.
- Since both are pointing to the same place in the heap when both go out of scope we get a [[double free memory error]]. 
- This is because we are trying to free the same address in memory twice, which can cause corruption.
- To prevent this in Rust when `s1` is assigned to `s2` it loses its validity. Therefore when `s1` goes out of scope nothing needs to be freed as it is invalid.
- This concept of copying only the stack information is called a [[shallow copy]] in other languages, but in Rust since the copy invalidates the original it is called a *move*.
- With this paradigm Rust never automatically creates [[deep copies]] of your data.

**Scope and Assignment**
- When a new value is assigned to an existing variable Rust calls `drop` and frees the original value's memory immediately.
**Variables and Data Interacting with Clone**
- If a deep copy is desired we use the `clone` method, `let s2 = s1.clone();`.
- This copies everything, including the memory on the heap.

**Stack-Only Data: Copy**
- Values on the stack are not beholden to the memory strictness of those on the heap, as such all copies of primitive types are deep copies.
- If any part of a type implements the `Drop` trait the Rust compiler won't let us annotate the type with the `Copy` trait.
- As a general rule scalar types implement the `Copy` trait.
##### **Ownership and Functions**
- Passing a variable to a function moves or copies the value, just like an assignment.
> [!example]-
> ```rust
> fn main() {
> 	let s = String::from("hello"); // s comes into scope
> 	takes_ownership(s); // s's value moves into the function... 
> 					// ... and so is no longer valid here
> 	let x = 5; // x comes into scope
> 	makes_copy(x); // x would move into the function
> 				// but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still 
> 				// use x afterward

> fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope 
> 	println!("{some_string}"); }
> // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing 
> // memory is freed.
> fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope 
> 	println!("{some_integer}"); 
> } // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.

##### **Return Values and Scope**
- Returning values also passes ownership.

##### Heap

The Heap is more unorganised, when string data on the heap you essentially request some space. The memory allocator then finds a some space of that size and dumps the data there, in return it gives you a pointer to that address in space. This is called *allocating*.

The pointer is a known fixed size so you can store that onto a stack, but do reach the data you must follow the pointer, think of a host seating you at a restaurant.

Pushing to stack is faster than allocating to heap because there is no search for where to allocate data, the computer just puts the data at the top of the stack every time.

When a function is called the values (including pointers) inside get pushed onto the stack, when the function ends they get popped off.

Ownership is the strategy rust uses to manage the Stack and Heap in an efficient and safe manner.

### Ownership Rules

1. Each value has an owner
2. There can only be one owner at a time
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

##### Variable Scope

variables are only available within the scope in which they are declared.

```rust
    {                      // s is not valid here, itâ€™s not yet declared
        let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid

```

When `s` comes into scope it is *valid*
When `s` comes out of scope it becomes *invalid*

##### String Type

The strings come in different flavours. There is the string literal which is what's used above. But this string is immutable and there are occasion, say user input, where we won't know already the size of the string. [[Rust Book - String]]

There is also the `String` types, which is data allocated to the heap. Written as:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
```

The `::` allows us to namespace the `from` function under the `String` type rather than using some name like `string_from`. More in [[Method Syntax]].

This kind of string can be mutated:

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

    println!("{s}"); // This will print `hello, world!`

```

The difference here is that a string literal is of a know size and can be accounted for at compile time. This makes it fast and efficient.
But the `String` type is allocated to heap to support a piece of text that can grow and change. Therefore the memory must be allocated at runtime, where Rust differs is in how it restores that memory when no longer in use.

In Rust the memory is restored, or returned, automatically when the variable that *owns* the data goes out of scope.

```rust
    {
        let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                       // longer valid
```

When a variable goes out of scope rust calls a special function for us automatically `drop` which deallocates the memory.

##### Variables and Data Interacting with Move

When using simple scalar values moving data like this is intuitive:

```rust
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;
```

x is 5 and y is 5 because the value of 5 isfixed and knowable.

In this case:

```rust
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;
```

`s1` and `s2` are not the same, since we are using the `String` type `s1` actually stores a pointer to an address on the heap that holds the data `"hello"`. `s2` also holds a pointer to that same address but these pointers are not equal.

Since `s1` and `s2` are pointing to the same address on the heap and rust automatically drops data once a variable is out of scope this has the potential of creating a memory error. Because once either variable falls out of scope, the data is deleted, even if the other variable is still in scope and needs access to that data.

To solve this, the moment `let s2 = s1` is called the variable `s1` is no longer valid, i.e. the owenership of that data passes from `s1` to `s2`.
This is known as a move. In this example `s1` was moved into `s2`.

##### Variables and Data Interacting with Clone

If there is the case where we want to deeply copy data that is on the heap we can use the special function `clone`.

```rust
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!("s1 = {s1}, s2 = {s2}");
```
This creates exact copy of the data on a different address in the heap, as such it can be quite expensive memory and time wise.

##### Stack Only Data: Copy

When dealing with types that are stored on the stack, such as integers, there is no need for a deep copy since the size of the data i know immidiately as such all copies are shallow copies and dat does not need to be moved around. We can use the `Copy` annotation for making copies of any trivial type.
If a type has the `Drop` annotation then it cannot be copied in this way.

### Ownership and Functions

Passing or moving values through functions work very similarly as with variables:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{some_string}");
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{some_integer}");
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens
```

Once the function `takes_ownership` is called `s` is no longer valid and cannot be called upon again. 

##### Return Values and Scope

Return values can also transfer ownership as seen here:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

ownership works the same every time, assigning a value to another variable moves it, including assigning to a function, when a variable with data stored in the heap goes out of scope, that data is dropped and the memory restored.

This can be tedious for reusing data.

To solve this rust uses [[Rust Book - References|references]] to use a value without passing ownership.

References, like pointers, are addresses to stored data. But unlike pointers a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value.

To denote a reference you append `&` before the type:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{s1}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

In this example the parameter `s` needs to be of type String reference, and the variable `s1` while initialised as a `String` is *passed* as a reference using `&`.

To dereference something you use the `*` operator, [[Rust Book - Smart Pointers#Treating Smart Pointers Like Regular References with the `Deref` Trait|see more]].

When using references values do not pass ownership and as such are valid until they leave scope.

We call the action of creating a reference *borrowing*.

Borrowed values are immutable by default.

The string literal is actually a [[Rust Book - Slice Type|slice]] of the binary thus making it the immutable reference: `&str`.

##### Mutable References

To make a reference mutable we use `&mut` instead. 

Mutable references have one big difference to immutable ones and that is there can only be one mutable reference to each value at a time, *simultaneously*. This means that there can be multiple mutable references to the same value in multiple different scopes but only one per scope:

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;
```

This is done so rust can avoid *data races*. A data race is when at compile time these three behaviours occur:

- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write tot the data
- There is no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data

These data races can cause unexpected behaviour and cause problems at run time.

You also cannot have a mutable reference to a value that already has an immutable reference within that same scope.




A slice lets you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection and since it is a reference this slice does not have ownership.
##### String Slices

A `String slice` is a reference to a part of a string, written as:

```rust
    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];
```

Slices are created by indicating a range in `[]` with it written like:

```rust
[start..end] // start: inclusive, end: not inclusive
```

To start at index 0 rust understands these two ranges to be the same:

```rust
[0..2]
[..2]
```

And these to be the same:

```rust
[3..len]
[3..]
```

if you want to take a slice of the entire string you can drop both ends:

```rust
[0..len]
[..]
```

##### String Slices as Parameters

String literals are actually just slices of the binary, they are type `&str` and are an immutable reference. As such it is better practice to pass around a `&str` (string slice) rather than a `String` since as a reference ownership is not changed.

This can keep your code more generic.

##### Other Slices

A `&str` is specific to slices but a slice can be applied to any collection. We can slice an array like so:

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &a[1..3];

assert_eq!(slice, &[2, 3]);
```

The slice above has the type: `&[i32]` and works the same as string slices do.
