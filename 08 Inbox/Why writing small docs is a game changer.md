# Why writing small docs is a game changer

> [!abstract] Summary
## Highlights
---
> As technical writers, we aim to make information clear, accessible, and actionable. But there’s another factor to consider: how the size of a document impacts its effectiveness. Small, focused docs can save time, reduce stress, and make the review process much smoother.

> The key is focusing on one self-contained idea. ... A small doc should address just one topic or change ... Err on the side of writing too small rather than too large ... Include all the necessary background so the reviewer doesn’t need to dig into other docs for clarity. ... Avoid making the doc so small that its implications are unclear. For example, if you’re proposing a new API, include usage examples to show how it works.
