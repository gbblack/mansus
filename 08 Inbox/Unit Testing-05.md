### Differentiating mocks from stubs
#### The types of test doubles
#### Mock (the tool) vs. Mock (the test double)
#### Don't assert interactions with stubs
#### Using mocks and stubs together
#### How mocks and stubs relate to commands and queries
### Observable behaviour vs. implementation details
#### Observable behaviour os not the same as a public API
#### Leaking implementation details: An example with an operation
#### Well-designed API and encapsulation
#### Leaking implementation details: An example with state
### The relationship between mocks and test fragility
#### Defining hexagonal architecture
#### Intra-system vs. inter-system communications
#### Intra-system vs. inter-system communications: An example
### The classical vs. London schools of unit testing, revisited
#### Not all out-of-process dependencies should be mocked out
#### Using mocks to verify behavior
