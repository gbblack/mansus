# Tech Takes the Pareto Principle Too Far

> [!abstract] Summary
## Highlights
---
> There’s a reason video games build what’s called a ‘vertical slice’. If you’re not familiar, a vertical slice is a single playable area, with all mechanics, final art, vfx, sfx, music, etc.

> The vertical slice is what game developers show publishers and investors to demonstrate not only that the game itself is going to be good, but also that the game development team has all the skills necessary to deliver the game to the level of polish the market demands.

> Contrast this with the tech industry, which submits for approval an ‘MVP’. A minimum viable product is the absolute least one can create that someone will pay for.

> The problem is that MVPs don’t actually establish whether the team /could/ get to a finished product, and in practice many can’t.

> Recently, getting VC funding has become such an end in itself that engineers in the tech industry, centered around Silicon Valley, have optimized their skillset for prototyping.

> What the Pareto Principle doesn’t capture, and what its adherents seem to forget, is that you still HAVE TO DO that last 20%. End users usually don’t enjoy using 80% of a website, or driving 80% of a car.
