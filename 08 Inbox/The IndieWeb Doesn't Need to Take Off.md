# The IndieWeb Doesn't Need to "Take Off"

The indieweb doesn't need to become popular to be valuable. It is the exercise of participating in it that make it worthwhile. It is a return to form for a more open, independent and free internet.

It's like saying that gardening hasn't taken off because most people buy their vegetables at the supermarket. The IndieWeb doesn't need to 'take off' to be valuable to those who participate in it. Maintaining a personal website is about owning your digital presence, embracing creative freedom and expressing your individuality! It's not about appealing to the masses!
