## Most Recent Notes

```dataview
TABLE dateformat(file.mtime, "dd.MM.yyyy - HH:mm") AS "Last modified"
FROM ""
SORT file.mtime DESC
LIMIT 5
```

## Latest Literature Notes

```dataview
LIST
FROM #literature AND -#literature/book_index AND -"05 Templates"
LIMIT 5
```


Ideas of things this could hold:

A list of Maps of content
using dataview a block showing the 5 latest edited notes
a lil intro block
a randomiser?

The home note should link to index Maps of Content?
Maybe a dataview tabel of the last 5 lit notes I worked on?
