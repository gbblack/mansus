### Guessing Game

**Problem:** The program will generate and random integer between 1-100. It asks for a guess. Player enters a guess, the problem will respond if its too high, too low, or correct. When correct the program exits.

To import libraries the keyword is `use`
To receive user input the library is `io`
`io` is from the `std` library.
So to import we write:
`use std::io`

check the [[std|std library]] library `prelude` for all std libraries that are imported by default and don't need to be explicitly brought in.
