# Preface

[[Learning Systems Thinking]]
### Notes

> It became apparent that communications and computing served each other so intimately that they might actually become the same thing.

> â€”Tracy Kidder, The Soul of a New Machine (Little, Brown and Company)

Opening Quote to the book, setting the tone.

> Beauty, she said, depends on our geography.

Here the author espouses the idea that we are not all beautiful everywhere. She goes on to elaborate that in her valley in Montana to be authentic was to be beautiful. This is because being authentic mattered in such a community where the practical realities of life required a lack of artifice. Genuine ability to manage the winter, bears, mud and moose of the area are beautiful qualities to have that in a city like New York would have you labelled out of touch.
