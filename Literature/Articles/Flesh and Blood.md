> British anthropologist named A. M. Hocart proposed that monarchs and institutions of government were originally derived from rituals designed to channel powers of life from the cosmos into human society. He suggested that “the first kings must have been dead kings,” and that individuals so honored only really became sacred rulers at their funerals.

Here in the start of the article the authors present the idea that in the beginning of human society structures of governance, and the individuals who ran them, were born not from the necessities of life but from trying to preserve life after death. Later in the introduction it states that recent archeological findings prove Hocart right and that the oldest burials in history seem to have raised people into royalty only after their deaths through burying them with great wealth.

> When Europeans first encountered North American societies, the only kings that existed were ritualistic play kings. If they overstepped the line, their subjects were always free to ignore them or move someplace else. The same went for any other system of authority. A police force that operated for only three months of the year and whose membership rotated annually was, in a certain sense, a play police force—which makes it slightly less bizarre that their members were sometimes recruited from the ranks of ritual clowns.

This ritualisation, the article goes on, extends beyond monarchy and into other facets of governance, such as the ideas of property or policing. This is because in early societies the power inherent to a king or police force belonged truly to the people who placed them there and not the station itself. The moment the king went against the people, the power, who made him they could just as easily remove him. The same logic stretched to other governance aspects, such as policing in this quote; as a ceremonial position ==the power is firmly held in the hands of the audience of this performance, not the performer==.

> Existing debates almost invariably begin with terms derived from Roman law, which conceive of freedom as based on the power of the individual (by implication, a male head of household) to dispose of his property as he sees fit. It is a blunt reality that someone in possession of a thing can do anything he wants with it, except that which is limited “by force or law.” Jurists have struggled with this formulation ever since, as it implies that freedom is essentially a state of primordial exception to the legal order. It also implies that property is not a set of understandings between people about who gets to possess things, but rather a relation between a person and an object of absolute power.

Here the article tries to explain why this shift in power has occurred from the time of our earliest ancestors to now. It goes on to refer to the precedent that Roman law created and enforces on us still this idea that ==freedom is only allowed so long as the *law* allows it==. Making it an exception to the order of *lawful* things. In the case of the Romans this law is based on the ==absolute power of an individual over something rather than from the consensus of the collective==.

> An answer is suggested by the sociologist Orlando Patterson, who points out that conceptions of property (and hence of freedom) in Roman law can be traced back to slave law. It is possible to imagine property as a relationship of domination between a person and thing because, in Roman law, the power of the master rendered the slave a thing, not a person with rights or legal obligations. (...) The very word “family” shares a root with the Latin _famulus,_ meaning “house slave,” via _familia,_ which referred to everyone under the domestic authority of a male head of household.

Here we are shown that the ideas of freedom and property in Roman culture were closely tied. ==A man is as *free* as the totality of his power over others and things==. A king is freer than his citizen, who is freer than his child, who is freer than the slave.

> What seems to have really shocked them, however, was not the whipping, boiling, branding, or cutting up of the enemy, but the fact that almost everyone in a Wendat village took part, even women and children. The violence seems all the more extraordinary once we recall how these same societies refused to spank children, punish thieves and murderers, or take any measure that smacked of arbitrary authority. In virtually all other areas of social life they were renowned for solving problems through calm and reasoned debate.

Here the author compares the Roman understanding of family as ownership to the Native American Wendat tribe. Often the wars between tribes were in retribution of previous injury and violence and any prisoners brought back were either brought into the tribe or shunned. If rejected the prisoners would be brutalised to death by the tribe including the women and children, in direct contradiction to their non violent approach to internal tribal disputes.

> what struck them as most remarkable was that “the French whipped, hanged, and put to death men from among themselves” rather than external enemies

This quote reference the Wendat tribesmen who visited France and were most struck not by the violence itself but rather than it was done by a people unto itself, an attack from the inside. This internal violence is the manifestation of the absolute power over another Roman's describe as freedom. ==The law is *free* to brutalise you as you are not *free* to disobey it.==

> While Native American rituals showed the desire to seize the strength and courage of an outsider so as to combat him better, the European ritual revealed the existence of a dissymmetry, an irrevocable imbalance of power within society itself. As a Wendat traveler observed of the French system, anyone—guilty or innocent—might end up being made a public example.

Here is the crux of the difference in these two histories. The Roman culture manifests its power over the violence it could commit on its own people, its possession. While the Wendat culture manifests its power on the consumption of the outside into itself, thereby safeguarding its internal society.

> Children were to submit to their parents, wives to husbands, and subjects to rulers, whose authority came from God. In each case the superior party was expected to inflict stern chastisement when he considered it appropriate: that is, to exercise violence with impunity.

An internal pyramid where the higher you are the freer you are. Later the article discusses how this violence was disguised as "love" and "family". The husband could beat his wife, the parents their children, the king his people and so on.

> Wendat torture, in the same period, created searing, unforgettable spectacles of pain and suffering to make clear that no form of physical chastisement should ever be countenanced inside a community or household. Violence and care, in the Wendat case, were to be entirely separated.

In the Wendat life violence is reserved for the outsider alone, while care is saved for family.
