# What is Systems Thinking?

> [!abstract] Summary
> Systems thinking is a practice that must be developed and maintained. It is not a thing you learn but a process you do. It allows for nonlinear thinking so as to be able to navigate complex problems.
### Quotes

17
> Systems thinking is a ==practice==, a perspective, a framework, an emerging language

18
> It is a book about ==thinking==. Because what we think, and communicate, is what we push to production.

> As software becomes systems of software, we have reached the limits of our traditional ways of thinking.

19
> Systems are nondualistic—the choice isn’t “ivory tower architect” versus “hands-on coder”…the choice is “which tool, practice, or approach will help us understand what we need to understand?

> Linear thinking is so ubiquitous, many of us don’t recognize it as one type of thinking. We call it, simply, thinking: predictable, rational, repeatable, procedural, dualistic, top-down, and concerned with control.

> ==Linear thinking is reductionistic==, understanding a whole by breaking it into parts.

> We break software (or a system of software) into parts or components. We model boxes with lines between them. We fit people (teams) into those boxes. When we outgrow that model, we re-create the boxes.

20
> Linear and nonlinear thinking are interrelated. This book is a matterful addition to your bookshelf because linear approaches cannot resolve systemic issues.

21
> Nonlinearity means that the act of playing the game has a way of changing the rules. . . . That twisted changeability makes nonlinearity hard to calculate, but it also creates rich kinds of behavior that never occur in linear systems.
> —James Gleick, Chaos: Making a New Science (Open Road Media)

> Systems are not fully controllable and unpredictable. Relationships among parts impact what happens.

22
> Learning all the time. Thinking deeply and also thinking deeply about thinking.

> Systems thinking  ==improves your capacity for doing difficult things==.
> Nonlinear approaches increase signal and decrease noise.

23
> This is important because ==systems are sociotechnical==. The principles and procedures people use and the framework or methods that structure our work are interrelated and inherently design our systems.

> In this book, we extend the definition of thinking to include ==structuring and communicating those thoughts==. 

24
> Systems thinking is a system of foundational thinking practices that, when done together, improve nonlinear thinking skills.

26
> Systems thinking is a ==mindshift==, away from linear and reductionist approaches toward nonlinear ones. The “right” way to achieve this mindshift depends on your skills and circumstances. There are many right ways.
