###### II. From Dark to Dawn
- [ ] In the `Index` section add each chapter to the list, following the structure of the book.
- [ ] Chapter by chapter link the `Index` chapter names to the corresponding chapter note. Do this as you read not all at once.

###### III. From Dawn to Day

- [ ] Update status tag to `status/day`.
- [ ] Remove this checklist.
